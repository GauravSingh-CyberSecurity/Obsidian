I.e copyright infringement that can be done using clean room design approach. 
Also called as clean room reverse engineering and clean room cloning. 

This can be used to illegally copy someone else's work/project/product 
If there work is leaked on internet(eg: some kind of opensource platform like wikileaks)or in the physical world somehow, even if not people can use the reference like windows(bill gates ) did with Apple (Steve jobs)


If you know all these things: all the research, specifications of the equipments , work on applications

We can use clean room design, seprate your designers(IP and everything else) from the original companies(owners) IP, 
And cover ourselves from copyright violations/infringement below is the guide for it :-

Clean room design is a technique used to create a new work, such as software or research, without directly copying or infringing on someone else's copyrighted work. Here's a general overview of how it works:

1. **Analysis of existing work**: The process begins with a team of analysts who study the existing copyrighted work (the "black box" team). They create a detailed specification or functional description of the work without directly referencing the original code or design.

2. **Creation of clean room environment**: A separate team (the "clean room" team) is then assembled in a controlled environment. This team has no access to the original work or the analysis created by the black box team.

3. **Development based on specification**: The clean room team uses the specification created by the black box team to independently develop the new work. They must rely solely on the information provided in the specification and cannot refer to the original work.

4. **Strict controls**: To ensure compliance with copyright laws, strict controls are enforced. The clean room team members are typically not allowed to have any knowledge of the details of the original work, and there are protocols in place to prevent any accidental exposure.

5. **Validation and testing**: Once the clean room team has completed their work, the new software or research is validated and tested to ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the specification.

6. **Legal review**: Before the new work is released or published, a legal review is often conducted to ensure that no copyright infringement has occurred.

By following this process, the clean room team can create a new work that is inspired by the original copyrighted work but does not directly copy or infringe upon it. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of copyright infringement.



Clean room reverse engineering, or clean room cloning, is a technique used to develop a product or technology that is similar to an existing one without directly copying it, especially in cases where the original source code or design is not available or legally accessible. 

In this process, one team analyzes the existing product and creates a detailed specification without referencing the original code or design (the "black box" team). Then, a separate team (the "clean room" team) uses this specification to independently develop the new product, ensuring they do not have access to the original code or design.

Whether individuals or companies who have engaged in this practice against IBM, Apple, Sony, or other companies have faced legal consequences can vary. Legal outcomes depend on many factors, including the specific details of the case, the jurisdiction, and the laws involved. In some cases, companies engaging in clean room reverse engineering have been able to avoid legal repercussions by demonstrating that they did not directly copy the original work. However, each case is unique, and legal advice should be sought to understand the risks and implications fully.





Yes, there have been cases where individuals or companies have engaged in clean room reverse engineering or similar practices and avoided legal consequences.


The "how" and "why" of individuals or companies avoiding legal consequences after engaging in clean room reverse engineering or similar practices can vary based on the specific circumstances of each case. However, some common reasons and methods include:

1. **Non-infringement:** In some cases, the recreated product or technology is sufficiently different from the original, demonstrating that no direct copying or infringement occurred. This can be a key factor in avoiding legal consequences.

2. **Legal defense:** Defendants may argue that their actions were legal under the doctrine of fair use, or that they had a legitimate right to reverse engineer the product for interoperability purposes.

3. **Settlement:** Sometimes, legal disputes are settled out of court, with the parties involved agreeing to terms that do not necessarily involve admitting guilt or wrongdoing.

4. **Jurisdictional differences:** Laws regarding intellectual property and copyright infringement can vary between jurisdictions, and what may be considered legal in one jurisdiction may not be in another.

5. **Lack of evidence:** In some cases, there may be insufficient evidence to prove that copyright infringement occurred, making it difficult for the plaintiff to succeed in legal action.

It's important to note that each case is unique, and the outcome depends on various factors, including the specific details of the case, the legal arguments presented, and the jurisdiction in which the case is heard.
