Explain your Owasp methodologies experience?

I have extensive experience utilizing OWASP methodologies, particularly the OWASP Top 10 and OWASP Testing Guide, during web application penetration testing and bug bounty assessments. My process begins with recon and threat modeling, aligning with OWASP’s structured approach to identifying risks. I actively test for common vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 such as:

Injection flaws (A1), like SQL and command injection,

Broken Authentication (A2), where I verify session management and credential weaknesses,

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and CSRF (A7/A8), by crafting payloads and analyzing context-specific input validation,

Security Misconfigurations (A6), such as exposed admin panels, verbose error messages, and outdated software,

Insecure Deserialization and insufficient logging and monitoring, especially when assessing complex business logic or session replay flaws."


I follow the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) for structured assessments, including:

WSTG-INFO-01 for fingerprinting web applications,

WSTG-AUTH-01 through 05 for authentication testing,

WSTG-CLNT-01 for testing client-side controls and JavaScript security.


Additionally, I use the OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard) to benchmark the security posture of applications during internal assessments. For automation and validation, I leverage tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom scripts, while mapping all findings to OWASP categories in my reporting to maintain transparency and clarity for remediation efforts.

How do you approach vulnerability assessment and penetration testing for web applications?

1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration (Information Gathering):
I begin with passive and active reconnaissance to gather data about the target such as domain names, subdomains, technologies used, server banners, and exposed endpoints. I use tools like:

Amass, Subfinder for subdomain enumeration

WhatWeb, Wappalyzer, BuiltWith for tech stack fingerprinting

Burp Suite, Nmap, Dirsearch, ffuf for active discovery


2. Threat Modeling:
Using the information gathered, I analyze the attack surface, user roles, and data flows. I identify high-value targets, trust boundaries, and potential entry points. OWASP methodologies (like the Top 10 and ASVS) guide this phase.

3. Automated Scanning:
I run automated vulnerability scanners such as:

Burp Suite Scanner, OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, and Nikto
These help identify low-hanging fruit (e.g., missing headers, outdated libraries, reflected parameters, open directories, etc.).


4. Manual Testing & Exploitation:
This is the most critical phase. I manually verify and exploit findings from automated scans, and I test for:

OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, SSRF, etc.

Authentication/Authorization issues, privilege escalation

Business logic flaws, rate limiting bypasses, file upload flaws
I use Burp Suite Professional, Postman, Browser Dev Tools, and custom scripts (Python/JS) for in-depth testing.


5. Exploit Verification & Risk Analysis:
Each finding is reproduced and analyzed for impact (e.g., data leakage, account takeover, remote code execution). Severity is assigned using CVSS or OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

6. Reporting & Remediation Guidance:
I prepare a detailed report including:

Executive Summary

Technical Findings with PoC screenshots/videos

Risk Ratings and OWASP/CWE mapping

Step-by-step remediation recommendations
I also offer a retest phase after fixes to validate security posture improvement.


7. Tools & Frameworks I Commonly Use:

Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, Nikto, ffuf, SQLMap

Amass, Subfinder, Shodan, Gobuster

OWASP WSTG, OWASP Top 10, ASVS, MITRE ATT&CK

Can you share an example of a challenging penetration test you conducted?


Engagement:
Web Application Penetration Test for a logistics platform built using Laravel 5.4 (Blade templating), hosted on AWS EC2, with MySQL and RESTful APIs.

Challenge: Incomplete Functionality Disclosure + Custom Auth

During the initial recon, there was no clear documentation or Swagger file for API endpoints, and the frontend logic relied heavily on JavaScript-based rendering. The application had a custom JWT-based authentication mechanism, rate-limiting was implemented at API gateway level, and there was a mix of old Laravel debugging artifacts still accessible.


---

Approach & Findings:

1. Enumeration:
I used Burp Suite's Repeater and Intruder, along with JSBeautifier and LinkFinder, to map hidden endpoints and JWT token flows by analyzing the minified JS and API calls.

2. Broken Access Control (IDOR):
By manipulating user IDs in the API requests, I discovered Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities allowing horizontal privilege escalation:

Regular users could view shipment details and PII of other users via /api/shipment/view?id=####


3. Debug Mode Exploitation:
I noticed that /__debugbar was exposed due to a misconfigured Laravel APP_DEBUG=true setting in .env, leading to sensitive info disclosure like:

MySQL credentials

Mail server config

Internal IPs
This was critical in staging and exposed further attack vectors in production.


4. File Upload Bypass → Web Shell Risk:
The file upload functionality used only client-side file extension checks. I bypassed it using:

image.php;.jpg

This was accepted and stored in the public directory, creating an RCE opportunity (though actual exploitation was halted as per rules of engagement).

5. Mitigation Guidance:
I helped the dev team implement:

Role-based access control middleware

Laravel Sanctum with proper token scoping

Disabling debug mode and access to .env

Server-side MIME validation and directory-based isolation for file uploads



---

Impact:

Identified 4 critical vulnerabilities and 3 medium-severity flaws

Prevented possible user data breaches and privilege escalations

Helped improve overall Laravel app security hygiene across environments
