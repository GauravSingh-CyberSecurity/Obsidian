# For Bug bounty 

No, you don’t need to complete any other Offensive Security (OffSec) certifications before attempting the OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert). However, it’s important to assess whether your current skills and experience match the technical requirements for OSWE.


---

When You Can Directly Attempt OSWE

You can skip other OffSec certifications if you:

1. Have hands-on experience in web application penetration testing.


2. Are proficient in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and PHP.


3. Understand and can exploit OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, SSRF).


4. Have some experience with source code review and identifying security flaws in web application code.




---

Benefits of Doing OSCP First (Optional)

While OSCP is not a prerequisite for OSWE, it’s beneficial because:

1. Core Pentesting Knowledge: OSCP focuses on fundamental penetration testing skills like enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and report writing.


2. Practical Experience: It provides a foundation for real-world pentesting, which complements OSWE’s web-specific skills.


3. Confidence Building: OSCP’s hands-on approach can boost your ability to approach OffSec exams effectively.



If you feel you lack confidence in general pentesting workflows or hands-on lab experience, OSCP is a good starting point.


---

Other Certifications to Consider Before OSWE (Optional)

1. eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester (eWPT):

Beginner-friendly.

Focuses solely on web vulnerabilities and exploitation.

Great stepping stone for OSWE.



2. TCM Security Practical Web Application Security and Testing (PWST):

Hands-on and web-focused.

Covers fundamental vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQLi, CSRF, and IDOR.



3. Burp Suite Certified Practitioner:

Focuses on mastering Burp Suite, a tool heavily used in OSWE.





---

Verdict

You can go straight to OSWE if:

1. You have a strong foundation in web application security.


2. You’re confident in your coding skills and practical pentesting abilities.



If you’re unsure, pursuing an intermediate certification like eWPT or starting with OSCP for general pentesting experience might help you prepare better.
