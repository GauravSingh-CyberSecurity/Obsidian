To learn and excel in bug bounty hunting, hereâ€™s a roadmap tailored for you:

1. Learn the Basics of Web Security

Web Technologies: Understand how web applications work (HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Networking: Solidify your knowledge of TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP methods.

Programming: Be comfortable with scripting languages like Python, Bash, or PowerShell. Know JavaScript well since many bugs involve it.


2. Study the OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a great starting point for common web vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Broken Authentication, etc.



3. Learn Hands-On with Labs

PortSwigger Web Security Academy: Great platform for learning and practicing web vulnerabilities.

Hack The Box (HTB) or TryHackMe: Excellent environments for practicing skills in simulated environments.


4. Master Burp Suite

Since you're already using Burp Suite Pro, dive deeper into its advanced features:

Automated scans

Custom extensions

Intruder and Repeater tools

Passive and Active Scanning



5. Learn Manual Testing

While tools like Burp Suite help, manual testing finds many unique bugs. Learn how to manually inspect requests, responses, cookies, and headers.


6. Follow Bug Bounty Platforms

Register and follow platforms like:

HackerOne

Bugcrowd

Synack

Open Bug Bounty


These platforms host many bug bounty programs and offer a great way to start earning bounties.


7. Explore Advanced Vulnerabilities

After mastering the OWASP Top 10, move on to more advanced topics:

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Insecure Deserialization

Logic Flaws

IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)



8. Join Bug Bounty Communities

Twitter, Reddit, and Discord: Engage with other hunters, attend bug bounty meetups, and stay updated with the latest trends and disclosed bugs.


9. Stay Updated on Exploits

Follow sites like CVE Details, Exploit-DB, and Packet Storm to stay updated with the latest vulnerabilities and patches.


10. Continuous Learning

Books: Consider reading "Web Application Hacker's Handbook" or "Real-World Bug Hunting."

Courses: Look for bug bounty-focused courses on platforms like Udemy or use bug bounty-specific learning platforms.


11. Develop a Methodology

As you participate in bug bounties, refine your methodology for hunting. This can include focusing on specific categories of bugs or developing scripts that assist you.


12. Practice on Real Targets

Start small: Begin with smaller, less competitive programs, and work your way up to bigger targets.
