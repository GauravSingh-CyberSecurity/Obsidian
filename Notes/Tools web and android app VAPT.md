2. Vulnerability Scanning

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): Open-source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web apps.

Nikto: Scans web servers for outdated versions, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.

Arachni: Automated security scanner for web applications.

Burp Suite: (You are already using this) Extensive web vulnerability scanning and manual testing tool.


3. Exploitation

SQLMap: Automates the process of finding and exploiting SQL injection flaws.

XSStrike: Advanced XSS detection suite.

Commix: For automated detection and exploitation of command injection vulnerabilities.

Metasploit: Exploit development and execution framework for known vulnerabilities.


4. Fuzzing

Wfuzz: Brute force web applications and test for vulnerabilities like LFI, XSS, SQLi, etc.

Gobuster: Fuzzing tool used to find directories, files, and DNS entries on web servers.

Dirb: For brute-forcing web server directories and files.


5. Web Application Testing Frameworks

OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG): Comprehensive guide for penetration testing.

Metasploit: For vulnerability testing with payloads and scripts.

WPScan: Focuses on WordPress site vulnerabilities.


6. Proxy Tools

Fiddler: HTTP/HTTPS traffic capture and analysis.

Charles Proxy: HTTP proxy/monitor for viewing and debugging HTTP requests and responses.


7. Miscellaneous

Postman: Useful for manual testing of REST APIs.

Hydra: Fast and flexible login cracker for brute-forcing web logins.

JWTTool: For testing vulnerabilities in JSON Web Tokens.


These tools will help you perform comprehensive web application pentesting by discovering, exploiting, and reporting vulnerabilities across a wide range of attack surfaces.









For Android mobile app penetration testing, here’s a list of essential tools that cover different aspects of the testing process:

1. Static Analysis Tools

MobSF (Mobile Security Framework): All-in-one static and dynamic analysis tool for Android APKs. Detects insecure coding practices, exposed APIs, and more.

APKTool: Decompile and recompile APK files for reverse engineering.

JD-GUI: Java decompiler to view the source code of Android APKs.

Dex2jar: Converts Android Dalvik bytecode (DEX) into Java bytecode (JAR).

Android Studio: Official IDE for Android development, useful for code review, debugging, and testing.

** jadx**: Fast decompiler to convert Android Dex files into Java source code.


2. Dynamic Analysis Tools

Frida: Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for hooking, monitoring, and manipulating running Android applications.

Drozer: Android security assessment framework for identifying security vulnerabilities in Android apps.

Objection: Runtime mobile exploration toolkit for Android, built on top of Frida.

Xposed Framework: Modify the behavior of apps and system services at runtime without touching the APK.

Strace: Monitor system calls made by the app.

gdb: Debugging tool that can be used to attach to a running app for deeper inspection.


3. Network Traffic Analysis

Burp Suite: Capture and analyze network traffic between the mobile app and backend servers. Works well with the Android emulator or a rooted device.

Wireshark: Analyze network traffic captured from a mobile device.

mitmproxy: HTTP/HTTPS proxy for intercepting and modifying network traffic in real-time.

SSL Unpinning Tools: Tools like Inspeckage or JustTrustMe bypass SSL pinning in mobile apps to inspect HTTPS traffic.


4. Reverse Engineering

Cutter: Open-source GUI for the radare2 reverse engineering framework, useful for analyzing Android binaries.

Ghidra: NSA-developed software reverse engineering suite for analyzing Android binaries.


5. Emulators & Virtual Devices

Genymotion: Fast Android emulator, useful for testing in different device environments.

Android Emulator: The official emulator from Android Studio.

NOX Player / BlueStacks: Android emulators for running apps in different virtual environments.


6. Root Detection and Bypass

Magisk: Root solution that allows hiding root status from apps.

RootCloak: Xposed module that bypasses root detection mechanisms in Android apps.


7. Exploit Development and Frameworks

Metasploit: Use with Android modules to exploit known vulnerabilities.

AndroBugs: Detect security vulnerabilities in Android apps during development or post-deployment.

Android SSL Pinning Bypass with Frida: Specific scripts for bypassing SSL pinning protections.


8. APK and Memory Dumping

adb: Android Debug Bridge for interacting with an Android device (installing APKs, logcat, pulling data, etc.).

ADEL (Android Data Extractor Lite): Extract data from a running Android app without rooting the device.

Memory Dump Tools: Use Frida or gdb for dumping memory from a running application to inspect encryption keys or sensitive data.


9. Vulnerability Scanners

Quark Engine: Analyze Android malware for detecting malicious code patterns.

QARK (Quick Android Review Kit): Automated Android application analysis to find potential vulnerabilities.


10. Additional Tools

Inspeckage: Android package inspector that hooks into the application for analysis of the app’s activities, permissions, network traffic, and storage.

AppMon: Monitor Android app API calls, file system access, and network traffic.


11. Manual Testing Resources

Android Debug Bridge (ADB): Essential for communicating with an Android device (pulling logs, manipulating files, etc.).

Logcat: Native logging system for real-time logging of system and app events.


These tools, combined with a strong understanding of Android’s architecture, will help you perform thorough pentesting of Android applications, covering everything from reverse engineering, network analysis, runtime instrumentation, to exploit development.
