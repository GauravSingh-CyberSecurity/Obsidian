As a beginner in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) for web applications, it's essential to start with common and widely recognized tests. Here's a list of 20 VAPT tasks you can try on a web application:

1. Information Gathering:

Perform reconnaissance using tools like whois, nslookup, and dig.

Use Google Dorking to find sensitive information.



2. URL Manipulation:

Test for hidden parameters by manipulating URL values.



3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Test for both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities by injecting scripts.



4. SQL Injection:

Try basic SQL injection attacks to see if the web application is vulnerable to SQLi.



5. Command Injection:

Attempt to inject OS commands through form fields or URL parameters.



6. File Inclusion:

Test for Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI).



7. Directory Traversal:

Use ../ to access directories outside the web root.



8. Broken Authentication:

Check for weak login mechanisms, default credentials, and session fixation issues.



9. Session Management:

Test for session hijacking and improper session timeout.



10. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):



Check if the application is vulnerable to CSRF by attempting unauthorized actions.


11. Security Misconfiguration:



Look for default configurations, error messages revealing sensitive information, and unpatched software.


12. Sensitive Data Exposure:



Examine how the application handles sensitive data and if it uses HTTPS properly.


13. Access Control Issues:



Test for broken access controls by accessing unauthorized resources.


14. Input Validation:



Check for improper input validation by submitting unexpected data types.


15. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards:



Test if the application properly validates URLs before redirecting.


16. Business Logic Flaws:



Analyze the application's logic to find flaws that could be exploited.


17. Automated Scanning:



Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to automate the scanning process.


18. Brute Force Attack:



Attempt to brute force login pages with commonly used passwords.


19. File Upload:



Test if you can upload malicious files and if the application validates file types properly.


20. Third-Party Components:



Identify and check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks used by the application.


Remember to always have proper authorization before conducting any VAPT activities on any web application. Unauthorized testing can be illegal and unethical.
