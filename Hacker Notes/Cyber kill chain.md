The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin to understand and counter cyber threats. It breaks down the stages of a cyberattack into seven distinct phases, enabling security professionals to detect and mitigate threats at each stage.

1. Reconnaissance

Goal: Identify potential targets and gather intelligence.

Activities:

Passive information gathering (open-source intelligence, social media, company websites).

Active reconnaissance (network scanning, probing for vulnerabilities).


Defenses:

Monitor for unusual activity (e.g., excessive website visits from the same IP).

Implement network scanning detection tools.




---

2. Weaponization

Goal: Create a payload to exploit vulnerabilities.

Activities:

Developing malware (e.g., viruses, Trojans, ransomware).

Creating phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.

Pairing exploits with delivery mechanisms (e.g., documents, macros).


Defenses:

Use sandboxing to analyze suspicious files.

Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.




---

3. Delivery

Goal: Transmit the payload to the target.

Activities:

Sending phishing emails.

Delivering malware via USB drives or direct network injection.

Exploiting web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).


Defenses:

Email filtering and anti-phishing tools.

Network security tools like firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).




---

4. Exploitation

Goal: Exploit a vulnerability to execute the attacker's payload.

Activities:

Exploiting outdated software or weak credentials.

Triggering malware in a victimâ€™s system.


Defenses:

Keep systems and software updated.

Use exploit mitigation techniques (e.g., ASLR, DEP).




---

5. Installation

Goal: Install malicious code on the target system.

Activities:

Installing backdoors or remote access tools (RATs).

Deploying keyloggers or persistence mechanisms.


Defenses:

Regular endpoint monitoring.

Implement application whitelisting.




---

6. Command and Control (C2)

Goal: Establish a channel to remotely control the compromised system.

Activities:

Communicating with malware over the internet (e.g., via DNS, HTTP, HTTPS).

Receiving commands from a C2 server.


Defenses:

Monitor outbound traffic for anomalies.

Use DNS filtering and block known malicious IPs.




---

7. Actions on Objectives

Goal: Execute the final goal of the attack.

Activities:

Data exfiltration.

Destroying data (e.g., ransomware encryption).

Lateral movement to compromise additional systems.


Defenses:

Implement network segmentation.

Monitor for unusual user activity and data access.

Importance of the Cyber Kill Chain

By understanding these stages, organizations can:

Detect and disrupt attacks at earlier phases.

Strengthen their defenses against specific tactics.

Respond effectively to incidents and minimize damage.
