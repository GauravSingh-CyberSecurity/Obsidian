1) Apply for remote jobs use startup accelerator (like YC companies, etc) to find remote jobs. And do multiple jobs if you like.

Great question, Gaurav.

Once a **Y Combinator (YC) startup becomes big** — like turning into a **unicorn** or **public company**, it often graduates from being seen as a “startup” and enters into one or more of the following **prestigious lists or categories**:

---

### ✅ 1. **YC's Own Public Lists (Best Place to Start)**

#### 🥇 **YC Top Companies List**

YC curates a list of the **most successful startups it has funded**, based on valuation, revenue, or impact.
