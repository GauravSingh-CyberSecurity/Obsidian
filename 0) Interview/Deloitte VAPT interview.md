## **Answers to Deloitte Application Security Tester Analyst Interview Questions**

***

### **Core Application Security Concepts**

**1. Can you explain your top 3 favorite OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and why they're significant?**  
- **Broken Access Control** – Leads to unauthorized data access; common in poorly enforced role-based security.  
- **Injection Attacks** – Example: SQL Injection can expose entire databases; prevent via parameterized queries.  
- **Cryptographic Failures** – Weak or no encryption compromises confidentiality; fix with strong algorithms like AES-256 and TLS 1.3.  

***

**2. How would you test for SQL Injection vulnerabilities?**  
- Use automated scanners (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) and manual payloads like `' OR '1'='1`.  
- Check error messages, blind injection with timing or Boolean methods.  
- Validate by confirming DB manipulation without credentials.  

***

**3. What's the difference between XSS types?**  
- **Stored XSS**: Malicious script stored in DB, affects all visitors.  
- **Reflected XSS**: Script sent in request, reflected in response.  
- **DOM-based XSS**: JS modifies DOM on client side without sanitization.  
- **Prevention**: Output encoding, CSP, input sanitation.  

***

**4. What secure coding principles do you follow?**  
- Validate all inputs (whitelisting approach).  
- Apply least privilege.  
- Avoid hard-coded credentials.  
- Defense in depth — multiple layers of security.  

***

**5. How do you ensure secure session management?**  
- Use secure, random session IDs.  
- Set HTTPOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags.  
- Invalidate sessions on logout and after inactivity.  

***

**6. Explain the difference between authentication and authorization.**  
- **Authentication**: Verifying identity (passwords, MFA).  
- **Authorization**: Defining what authenticated users can access (role-based/attribute-based).  

***

### **Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment**

**7. What penetration testing methodologies are you familiar with?**  
- **OWASP Testing Guide** for apps.  
- **PTES** for end-to-end testing.  
- **NIST SP 800-115** for formal assessments.  

***

**8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities in a penetration test report?**  
- Assess using **CVSS scores**, exploitability, and business impact.  
- Consider asset criticality and likelihood of exploitation.  

***

**9. Walk me through your approach to conducting a web application security test.**  
- Recon (Google Dorking, WHOIS, etc.)  
- Scanning with DAST/SAST.  
- Manual testing for business logic flaws.  
- Exploitation & PoCs.  
- Reporting & remediation guidance.  

***

**10. What security testing tools do you prefer and why?**  
- **Burp Suite** – interactive testing.  
- **OWASP ZAP** – free/open-source scanner.  
- **SonarQube/Checkmarx** – static analysis.  

***

**11. How do you handle false positives in vulnerability scans?**  
- Reproduce manually.  
- Cross-check with secondary tools.  
- Only report after verifying technical validity.  

***

### **Threat Modeling**

**12. Explain the STRIDE threat modeling methodology.**  
- S: Spoofing  
- T: Tampering  
- R: Repudiation  
- I: Information Disclosure  
- D: Denial of Service  
- E: Elevation of Privilege  
- Used to map threats to assets in architecture.  

***

**13. How do you conduct a threat modeling session?**  
- Identify assets and trust boundaries.  
- Create Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs).  
- Identify threats via STRIDE/misuse cases.  
- Recommend mitigations.  

***

**14. What threat modeling tools have you used?**  
- Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool.  
- OWASP Threat Dragon for lightweight modeling.  

***

### **Secure SDLC**

**15. How do you integrate security into the SDLC?**  
- Add security requirements in design.  
- Review code with SAST/DAST early.  
- Include penetration testing before release.  

***

**16. What's your approach to secure code review?**  
- Check for input validation, authentication flaws, hard-coded credentials, encryption usage.  
- Use automated tools first, then manual deep dive.  

***

**17. How do you ensure compliance with secure coding standards?**  
- Follow **OWASP ASVS** and secure coding guidelines.  
- Automate checks in CI/CD pipeline.  
- Conduct developer training.  

***

### **Technical Deep-Dive**

**18. Difference between symmetric & asymmetric encryption?**  
- **Symmetric**: One key for encryption/decryption (AES). Faster.  
- **Asymmetric**: Public/private key pair (RSA, ECC). More secure for key exchange.  

***

**19. How do you implement secure data transmission?**  
- Use TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites.  
- Enable certificate pinning.  
- Avoid deprecated protocols (SSL, TLS 1.0).  

***

**20. Handling sensitive data in applications?**  
- Encrypt at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS).  
- Tokenize or mask PII.  
- Restrict DB access via RBAC.  

***

**21. How to secure a web application's network architecture?**  
- DMZ for public-facing services.  
- Web Application Firewall (WAF).  
- Segregated VLANs for sensitive components.  

***

**22. Prevent and detect MITM attacks?**  
- Enforce HTTPS & HSTS.  
- Use signed certificates.  
- Detect anomalies with intrusion detection systems.  

***

### **Scenarios**

**23. Security scans slow down releases — what to do?**  
- Use risk-based scanning — focus on critical modules.  
- Shift-left: integrate security earlier.  
- Automate scans in CI/CD.  

***

**24. Critical vulnerability in production — steps?**  
- Immediately assess impact.  
- Inform stakeholders (within incident response plan).  
- Apply hotfix or temporary mitigation.  
- Post-incident review & root cause fix.  

***

**25. Security testing strategy for microservices?**  
- Test each service’s API endpoints.  
- Secure service-to-service authentication (mTLS).  
- Container scanning for images.  

***

- Supply chain attacks (e.g., dependency poisoning).  
- AI-based phishing/social engineering.  
- Cloud misconfiguration exploits.  

***

**27. How do you stay updated?**  
- Follow CVE/NVD feeds.

- Take certifications & attend security conferences.  

***

### **Behavioral**
