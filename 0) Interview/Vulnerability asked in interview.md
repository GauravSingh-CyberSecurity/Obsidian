Thanks for clarifying, Gaurav.

It looks like you meant **PLRF vulnerabilities**. But just to confirm: **"PLRF" isn't a widely recognized standard acronym in cybersecurity**. It could refer to something specific in a proprietary system, internal tool, or even a typo.

Here are a few possible interpretations and what their vulnerabilities might mean:

---

### ✅ 1. **Possible typo for "PRLF"** (Poor Log Retention and Forwarding):

- **Context**: Sometimes discussed in logging/monitoring misconfigurations.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
    - Incomplete or missing logs (can’t trace attacks).
    - Logs not forwarded to SIEM → delayed detection.
    - Local log tampering.
    - Violation of **ISO 27001 / SOC2** requirements.

---

### ✅ 2. **Possible typo for "PL/SQL" vulnerabilities**:

- Especially in **Oracle DBs**, common issues:
    - SQL Injection in PL/SQL procedures.
    - Overly permissive access to PL/SQL packages.
    - Hardcoded credentials or logic flaws.

---

### ✅ 3. **PLRF = Personal Laser Range Finder** (in military equipment):

- If you're referring to vulnerabilities in **PLRF military equipment**:
    - **Wireless comms** → interception or spoofing.
    - **Firmware vulnerabilities** → reverse engineering or backdoors.
    - **GPS spoofing** or jamming.
    - **Physical tampering** → leading to data leakage or mission compromise.

---

### ✅ 4. **In Web App / VAPT context – PLRF as an Internal Acronym**:

If you're testing an internal tool or web app and “PLRF” is a module name (e.g., **Project Lifecycle & Resource Framework**), you might want to check:

- **Authentication bypass**
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**
- **Insecure API endpoints**
- **Misconfigured ACLs**
- **Stored XSS or CSRF**

---

### What to do:

Please confirm **what PLRF stands for in your case** — if it's:

- A **web app/module**, I’ll guide you on specific vulnerabilities to test.
- A **hardware device**, I can explain reverse engineering or firmware-related attacks.
- A **typo**, I’ll correct the interpretation.

Let me know the context (web app, IoT, script, etc.), and I’ll give you detailed vulnerability types, attack vectors, and test cases.

Great question, Gaurav.

In interviews—especially for **security testing, VAPT, or bug bounty roles**—you are often asked about vulnerabilities **beyond OWASP Top 10**. These are **lesser-known, unrecognized, or uncommon vulnerabilities** that show deep practical understanding.

Here's a detailed list of **uncommon / unrecognized vulnerabilities** in:

---

---

## 💡 Interview Tip:

When asked in interviews:

✅ **Mention 1-2 common ones (XSS, SQLi)** only briefly,  
✅ Then move to **lesser-known ones** like:

- _Host Header Injection_
- _HTTP Smuggling_
- _Mass Assignment_
- _GraphQL abuse_
- _Exported components in Android_

And then **add a real-life bug bounty or CVE example** if possible. That always impresses.

If you want I can also make a **PDF cheat sheet** of these or **sort them based on severity, impact, and where they apply** (Dev, QA, Prod). Let me know!

Awesome, Gaurav. Let’s **explain each lesser-known vulnerability** — **Web App, API, and Android** — with a **real-world style explanation**, **how it works**, **how attackers exploit it**, and **how to test or fix it**.

---

## 🕸️ **WEB APP VULNERABILITIES — EXPLAINED**

---

### 1. **Host Header Injection**

- **What:** The `Host` header in HTTP is trusted by backend apps/CDNs.
- **Attack:** You change the header like:
    
    ```
    Host: attacker.com
    ```
    
    → and the app builds password reset links or redirects using this.
- **Use cases:** Cache poisoning, password reset poisoning, SSRF.
- **Fix:** Always validate `Host`, or use a strict whitelist.

---

### 2. **Web Cache Deception**

- **What:** Tricking CDN or server to cache private data as public.
- **Attack:**
    - Access `/user/profile.php/nonexistent.css`
    - CDN caches it as static.
    - Next visitor sees _your_ profile.
- **Fix:** Don’t cache URLs with cookies/sensitive data. Use cache-control headers.

---

### 3. **HTTP Request Smuggling**

- **What:** Backend and frontend servers parse HTTP differently (CL.TE vs TE.CL).
- **Attack:** Craft conflicting headers:
    
    ```
    Content-Length: 5  
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
    ```
    
    → allows attacker to "smuggle" a request and hijack other sessions.
- **Fix:** Use same HTTP parsing rules across all proxies/load balancers.

---

### 4. **Parameter Pollution**

- **What:** Same parameter repeated multiple times:
    
    ```
    ?id=1&id=admin
    ```
    
- **Effect:** Some systems take first, some take last → attacker overrides logic.
- **Fix:** Sanitize duplicates or reject duplicate parameters.

---

### 5. **Business Logic Vulnerability**

- **What:** Exploiting flaws in application flow.
- **Example:** Buying a product with `price=-100`, skipping payment step, or changing `userId=123` to `124`.
- **Fix:** Enforce server-side validation and role checks at every step.

---

### 6. **JWT 'none' Algorithm**

- **What:** JWT tokens have a signing algorithm. Some apps accept:
    
    ```json
    { "alg": "none" }
    ```
    
    → and treat unsigned JWT as valid.
- **Fix:** Disallow `none` algorithm; validate token signature always.

---

### 7. **Prototype Pollution**

- **What:** In JavaScript, objects inherit from prototypes. If you allow user to write:
    
    ```json
    { "__proto__": { "admin": true } }
    ```
    
    → can affect global objects → logic flaws or XSS.
- **Fix:** Block `__proto__`, `constructor`, and dangerous fields in user input.

---

### 8. **Template Injection**

- **What:** Rendering user input in template engines:
    
    ```html
    Hello {{name}}
    ```
    
    If unfiltered, attacker injects:
    
    ```
    {{7*7}} or {{__class__.__mro__}}
    ```
    
    → leads to code execution (e.g., in Jinja2 or Twig).
- **Fix:** Never trust template variables. Use sandboxing or strict template escaping.

---

---

## 🔌 **API VULNERABILITIES — EXPLAINED**

---

### 1. **Mass Assignment**

- **What:** Sending unwanted fields in API request:
    
    ```json
    { "username": "gaurav", "isAdmin": true }
    ```
    
    If backend binds data directly to user object → you become admin.
- **Fix:** Use allowlists to bind only safe fields (aka DTOs).

---

### 2. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA / IDOR)**

- **What:** Changing resource IDs:
    
    ```
    GET /api/user/123 → change to /api/user/124
    ```
    
    → if server doesn’t check ownership → data leak or update other’s account.
- **Fix:** Check if requesting user has access to the object.

---

### 3. **Improper Rate Limiting**

- **What:** No throttle → brute force login/OTP/api keys.
- **Test:** Send same request 100 times with Burp Intruder.
- **Fix:** Use 429 responses, CAPTCHA, or WAF rules.

---

### 4. **Unrestricted File Upload**

- **What:** API allows upload of `.svg`, `.php`, `.js` without filtering → attacker can execute code or inject JS.
- **Fix:** Use allowlists (`.png`, `.jpg`), scan content type, or store files outside the web root.

---

### 5. **Swagger/OpenAPI Exposure**

- **What:** `/swagger.json` or `/v2/api-docs` left public → reveals all endpoints, including internal/debug ones.
- **Fix:** Restrict API docs behind authentication.

---

---

## 📱 **ANDROID VULNERABILITIES — EXPLAINED**

---

### 1. **Exported Activities / Components**

- **What:** If an Activity or Service is `exported`, other apps can launch it via `Intent`.
- **Attack:** Attacker creates fake app that sends intent with admin commands.
- **Fix:** Set `exported="false"` unless absolutely required.

---

### 2. **Tapjacking**

- **What:** A transparent app overlays screen → user clicks a hidden button.
- **Attack:** Trick user into clicking "Send money" button on banking app.
- **Fix:** Use `filterTouchesWhenObscured=true`.

---

### 3. **WebView Misuse**

- **What:** Loading untrusted URL in WebView with JS enabled:
    
    ```java
    webView.loadUrl("http://attacker.com");
    webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
    ```
    
- **Attack:** JavaScript can access app functions via exposed interfaces.
- **Fix:** Never enable JS or load untrusted URLs.

---

### 4. **Insecure Storage**

- **What:** App stores passwords or tokens in:
    - Shared Preferences
    - SQLite DB
    - External storage (SD Card)
- **Fix:** Use Android Keystore + encrypted storage.

---

### 5. **Hardcoded Secrets**

- **What:** API keys and secrets inside APK (`strings.xml`, `.java`, `build.gradle`)
- **Attack:** Use tools like **JADX**, **MobSF**, **APKTool** to extract.
- **Fix:** Use backend proxy, dynamic key exchange, or environment variables.

---

### 6. **Debuggable APK**

- **What:** APK built with `android:debuggable=true` in Manifest.
- **Effect:** Anyone can connect via `adb`, dump memory, inspect data.
- **Fix:** Turn off debuggable flag before release build.
