Here’s a **complete list of tricks** that people working at **FAANG and top security companies** know and use when applying for **VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing)** or **Application Security** roles. These are **insider strategies** you can start using **right now**, tailored for someone like you.

---

## 🔥 MASTER LIST: FAANG-Level Tricks for VAPT Job Applications

---

### ✅ 1. **Always Apply with a Referral**

> 🔐 FAANG hiring works on **who you know**, not just what you know.

- Search LinkedIn for current employees (filter by company + "security engineer", "appsec", "pentester").
- Target alumni or Indian employees — higher response rate.
- DM politely asking for a referral and show your skills.
- **Bonus:** Build GitHub/portfolio _before_ asking — increases chance of referral.

---

### ✅ 2. **Use Keywords from Job Descriptions**

> 🧠 FAANG uses Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that filter resumes before humans see them.

- Extract key terms like:  
    `OWASP`, `SSRF`, `IDOR`, `Burp Suite`, `Web/Mobile App Testing`, `Red Team`, `MITRE ATT&CK`, `SIEM`, etc.
- Include these exact terms in:
    - Resume summary
    - Experience bullets
    - Skills section

---

### ✅ 3. **Tailor Resume Per Job**

> 📄 Never send the same resume twice.

- Align your resume exactly to the job title:
    - For "AppSec Engineer" → focus on SDLC, SAST, DAST, API testing
    - For "Pentester" → focus on VAPT, manual exploitation, tool usage
- Show **impact + tools**:
    - “Found and exploited XXE in Laravel API using Burp Collaborator, resulting in unauthorized file disclosure.”

---

### ✅ 4. **Early Application Timing**

> ⏰ Apply **within 24–48 hours** of job post. Recruiters often don’t even open old applicants.

- Use job alert tools:
    - [LinkedIn Job Alerts](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs)
    - [Simplify.jobs](https://simplify.jobs/)
    - [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/jobs/)
    - [YCombinator Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/)

---

### ✅ 5. **Maintain a Security Portfolio**

> 📁 Real hackers show, not tell.

Include:

- GitHub with:
    - Burp Extensions or Python/PowerShell scripts
    - CVE writeups (with PoC redacted)
- Blog with:
    - VAPT reports
    - HTB/THM writeups
    - Real attack chains and remediations
- Personal website = 💯 bonus

---

### ✅ 6. **Certify, But Smartly**

> 🎓 Certs open the door, PoC skills walk you in.

**Cert Path (Recommended):**

|Phase|Certifications|
|---|---|
|Beginner|eJPT, CEH, HTB CPTS/BBH|
|Intermediate|OSCP, CRTP, PNPT|
|Advanced|OSWE, OSEP, CRTO, SANS GWAPT|

- OSWE = AppSec-focused (great for FAANG)
- OSEP = Adversary simulation (Red Team)
- Add "OSCP in progress" in headline if not yet certified.

---

### ✅ 7. **LinkedIn Profile Optimization**

> 🤖 Recruiters use Boolean search: “(AppSec OR Pentester) AND (Burp OR OSCP)”.

- Update headline:  
    `VAPT | Web + Mobile App Pentester | OSCP | Burp Suite Pro | AppSec`
- Use banner image related to cybersecurity
- Fill out **Skills**, **Projects**, **Certs**, and **Featured** sections

---

### ✅ 8. **Connect With the Right People**

> 👥 Network like a pro.

- People to connect with:
    - Security Engineers
    - Red Teamers
    - AppSec Managers
    - Recruiters at FAANG / security consultancies
- Don’t just connect — comment on their posts, engage technically

---

### ✅ 9. **Use Side Doors (Bug Bounty, Freelance, Red Team Platforms)**

> 🔍 Real experience without a job title.

- Join and build rep on:
    - HackerOne
    - Bugcrowd
    - Synack Red Team
    - Intigriti
    - Try freelance pentesting via Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr (initially)
- Show these in resume under “Projects” or “Freelance Experience”

---

### ✅ 10. **Red Team/Pentest Firms as FAANG Stepping Stones**

> 🧱 FAANG often poaches from elite security firms.

Apply to:

- **NetSPI**
- **NCC Group**
- **Mandiant**
- **Synack / Cobalt Core**
- **EY / PwC Cybersecurity**
- **Traceable AI / Bishop Fox**

Build your rep → move to FAANG later.

---

### ✅ 11. **Practice Real Interviews**

> 🧪 Technical rounds test your thinking, not tools.

Common tests:

- Manual web app testing (OWASP Top 10)
- Report writing task (usually redacted findings)
- CVE analysis or simple RE
- SQLi/IDOR/Broken Auth exploitation
- Tools: Burp, Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, ZAP

Practice at:

- TryHackMe Red Team Labs
- HTB AppSec/Pro Labs
- VulnHub
- Offensive Security PWK Labs (if on OSCP path)

---

### ✅ 12. **Use STAR Format for Interviews**

> 💬 Structure matters.

Example:

> **S**: Client web app was vulnerable to IDOR  
> **T**: I had to assess user permission levels  
> **A**: Used Burp Repeater + user token replay  
> **R**: Found 3 major flaws, reported with PoC + fixes

---

### ✅ 13. **Reverse Job Application via Content**

> 📣 You attract recruiters by **sharing insights.**

- Weekly posts on LinkedIn:
    - “How I found a critical SSRF in a test app”
    - “Tools I used in my last web pentest”
- Blog on:
    - Laravel or PHP security issues (if tech stack is known)
    - Red Team reports or case studies
- Create short videos or writeups for engagement

---

### ✅ 14. **Cold Email Like a Pro**

**Subject:** VAPT Engineer – Resume & Portfolio Attached

> Hi [Hiring Manager],  
> I’m Gaurav, an engineer specializing in web/mobile/network pentesting. I’ve conducted 25+ assessments using Burp Suite, OWASP, Python, and Bash. I’ve attached my resume and portfolio (PoCs, reports, writeups).
> 
> Would appreciate if you’d consider me for any open roles or keep me in mind for future positions.
> 
> Thanks,  
> Gaurav  
> [LinkedIn] | [Email] | [Phone]

---

### ✅ 15. **Prepare a Clean, Branded Resume**

> 📌 Bonus points for design and clarity.

- Use tools: [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com), [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com), [Teal HQ](https://tealhq.com)
- Use sections:
    - Summary (with tools + years)
    - Experience (action + impact)
    - Projects (title + result)
    - Certifications
    - Skills (grouped: Tools, Languages, Frameworks)

---

### ✅ 16. **Know FAANG VAPT Hiring Patterns**

> 📅 Timing matters.

- Hiring seasons: **Jan–Mar**, **Jul–Oct**
- New budgets, new roles = more chances
- Prep during off months, apply heavily during peaks

LinkedIn DM Template (VAPT-Specific):

> Hi [Name], I came across your profile while exploring security roles at [Company]. I’m currently working in VAPT and have hands-on experience in web/mobile/network pentesting, Burp Suite Pro, and scripting. If you're open, I’d love to ask for a quick referral to the [Job Title] opening I saw — happy to share my resume and respect your time. Thanks in advance!




---

✅ 2. Use Security Portfolios Instead of Just a Resume

> Recruiters and security leads want to see what you’ve done, not just what you list.



FAANG-style VAPT portfolio includes:

GitHub link with:

Custom Burp Suite extensions/scripts

PoCs of CVEs (safely redacted)
