People working at FAANG (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) or similar top-tier tech companies often know and use **strategic tricks** when applying for jobs. These aren’t unethical shortcuts — they are smart, insider strategies. Here are some of the most effective:

---

### ✅ 1. **Referral First, Apply Later**

- **Why it works:** Internal referrals _bypass resume filtering systems (ATS)_ and get reviewed by a real recruiter.
- **How they do it:**
    - Search for employees on LinkedIn (preferably alumni or 2nd connections).
    - Send a personalized message:
        
        > "Hi [Name], I noticed you're working at [Company]. I'm applying for the [Role] and would love any advice you could share. If you feel comfortable, would you consider referring me?"
        
    - Keep it short and respectful. Many FAANG employees get bonuses for successful referrals.

---

### ✅ 2. **Tailored Resumes for Each Role**

- **Why it works:** FAANG roles often use keyword-based filters before a recruiter even sees your resume.
- **How they do it:**
    - Scrape the job description.
    - Mirror **exact keywords** from responsibilities and qualifications in your resume (especially in the top 1/3).
    - Use **quantifiable achievements** (e.g., “Improved latency by 32%…”)

---

### ✅ 3. **Apply Within the First 48 Hours**

- **Why it works:** FAANG roles get thousands of applications. Early ones are seen first, and the bar is lower at the beginning.
- **How they do it:**
    - Set job alerts on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Google Careers, and company sites.
    - Use tools like **Simplify Jobs**, **Rezi**, **Huntr**, and **Levels.fyi**.

---

### ✅ 4. **Leetcode, But With a Strategy**

- **Why it works:** Coding rounds are heavily pattern-based.
- **How they do it:**
    - Use **NeetCode 150**, **Blind 75**, and **Top Interview Questions** from Leetcode.
    - Focus more on **mastering patterns** (e.g., sliding window, recursion, DP) than solving random problems.
    - Simulate real interviews using **Pramp**, **Interviewing.io**, or **Exercism**.

---

### ✅ 5. **Hack the LinkedIn Algorithm**

- **Why it works:** FAANG recruiters often use LinkedIn Recruiter to search for candidates.
- **How they do it:**
    - Optimize headline: “Ex-[Top Company] | SWE | C++ | Backend | Open to New Roles”
    - Set “**Open to Work**” to recruiters only.
    - Add all major buzzwords in the **Skills** and **About** section.

---

### ✅ 6. **Networking Through GitHub & Conferences**

- **Why it works:** Demonstrates real contribution and gets attention from engineers (who refer better than HR).
- **How they do it:**
    - Contribute to open-source projects from big tech orgs.
    - Attend or speak at **meetups, hackathons, or DEF CON/BSides (for security roles)**.
    - Leave intelligent comments on engineers' blogs or GitHub issues — build visibility before asking for help.

---

### ✅ 7. **Use Internal Job Boards**

- **Why it works:** Internal job boards have roles that aren’t posted publicly.
- **How they do it:**
    - Employees check internal openings and refer candidates before public listing.
    - Get close to someone on the inside — even a **contractor or intern** can see these roles.

---

### ✅ 8. **Positioning Using Side Projects**

- **Why it works:** FAANG recruiters want to see initiative and product thinking.
- **How they do it:**
    - Build small, polished projects that demonstrate depth (not breadth).
    - Deploy them, write a blog post, share on GitHub.
    - Examples: Monitoring tool, full-stack app with auth + payments, mini compiler, or a security scanner if you’re into infosec.

---

### ✅ 9. **Timing is Everything**

- **Why it works:** FAANG hiring ramps up in **Jan–Mar** and **Aug–Oct**.
- **How they do it:**
    - Apply heavily during these windows.
    - Use off-seasons for **skill-building and networking**, not applying.

---

### ✅ 10. **FAANG Resume Review Tools**

- Tools they use:
    - **Resume Worded** – analyzes your resume for ATS and recruiter impact.
    - **Resumake**, **Enhancv**, **Teal HQ** – modern formatting, live tracking.
    - **HackerRank/CodeSignal practice** – simulate screening tests.
