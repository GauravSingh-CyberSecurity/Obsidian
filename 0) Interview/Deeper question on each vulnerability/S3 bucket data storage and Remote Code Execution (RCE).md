if data is stored on S3 bucket will it be rce or not.

give both cases

The relationship between S3 bucket data storage and Remote Code Execution (RCE) depends on the specific configuration, access controls, and how the stored data is used. Here are both cases:

## Case 1: S3 Buckets **Are NOT** Vulnerable to RCE by Default

**Standard S3 storage behavior:**
- Data stored in S3 buckets is inherently **static storage only**[1]
- S3 buckets themselves do not execute code - they simply store and serve files[1]
- Properly configured private buckets with appropriate access controls pose minimal RCE risk[1]
- S3 is designed as object storage, not as an execution environment[2]

**When S3 remains secure:**
- Buckets with proper IAM policies and access controls[1]
- Private buckets that require authentication[3]
- Buckets with content filtering and upload restrictions[1]
- Encrypted data storage with proper key management[4]

## Case 2: S3 Buckets **Can Lead to** RCE in Certain Scenarios

**Malicious uploads and execution:**
- Attackers can upload malware to misconfigured S3 buckets with weak access controls[1][2]
- If applications automatically download and execute files from S3 buckets, malicious code can be triggered[5]
- **Bucket Monopoly attacks** where attackers claim abandoned bucket names and wait for legitimate services to use them, leading to automatic code execution[6][7]

**Specific RCE attack vectors:**

### 1. Application-Level Vulnerabilities
- Applications that deserialize data from S3 buckets can be exploited for RCE through malicious payloads[5]
- Scripts that automatically download and execute JAR files or other executables from S3 buckets[8]

### 2. Shadow Resource Attacks
- AWS services like CloudFormation, Glue, EMR, and SageMaker automatically create S3 buckets with predictable names[6][7]
- Attackers pre-claim these bucket names in unused regions and store malicious code[6]
- When legitimate users enable these services, the malicious code executes automatically, potentially creating admin users[6]

### 3. Supply Chain Attacks
- Compromised S3 buckets serving as artifact repositories can distribute malicious versions of applications[5]
- Build systems that pull dependencies from S3 can execute malicious code during compilation[5]

**Common misconfigurations leading to RCE:**
- Publicly accessible buckets (31% of S3 buckets are currently public)[9]
- Lack of content filtering allowing malicious file uploads[1][2]
- Overly permissive bucket policies[4]
- Applications that trust and execute content from S3 without validation[5]

## Key Takeaway

S3 buckets themselves are not inherently vulnerable to RCE, but they become a vector for RCE when combined with application vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or automated systems that execute stored content without proper validation[5][6][7]. The risk lies not in the storage itself, but in how applications interact with and process the stored data.
