## **Answers to 1-Hour Second Round Questions**

***

### **OWASP & Web Application Vulnerabilities**

**1. Explain the OWASP Top 10 2021 in detail. Most critical?**  
- Covers: Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, Injection, Insecure Design, Security Misconfigurations, Vulnerable Components, Identification Failures, Data Integrity Failures, Logging Issues, SSRF.  
- **Most critical in today’s context**: Broken Access Control — found in 94% of tested apps, can lead to privilege escalation and data breaches.

**2. Testing for SQL Injection:**  
- Automated tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.  
- Manual: `' OR 1=1 --`, UNION injections, Boolean/time-based.  
- Verify via database behavior and controlled exploitation.

**3. Types of XSS + Prevention:**  
- Stored: Sanitizing input before DB storage.  
- Reflected: Encode user input before rendering.  
- DOM-based: Validate and sanitize in JS.  
- CSP headers, frameworks with auto-escaping.

**4. CSRF vs XSS:**  
- **CSRF**: Forces a logged-in user to perform an action → solved by anti-CSRF tokens, same site cookies.  
- **XSS**: Injects malicious scripts.  
- Real example: Changing password without consent.

**5. SSRF & Cloud Impact:**  
- Exploits server’s ability to make HTTP requests.  
- In cloud, can steal metadata from `169.254.169.254` and obtain credentials.  
- Mitigation: Whitelist outbound requests, metadata protection.

### **Security Testing Methodologies**

**6. SAST / DAST / IAST differences:**  
- **SAST**: Static code scan without execution — early stage.  
- **DAST**: Runtime app testing — detects runtime flaws.  
- **IAST**: Hybrid — instrumented at runtime for deeper insight.

**7. Pen-test multiple user roles:**  
- Build test accounts for each role.  
- Verify horizontal & vertical access controls.  
- Test business logic across roles.

**8. API Security Testing:**  
- Check authentication, authorization, rate limiting.  
- Test for mass assignment, insecure direct object references (IDOR), excessive data exposure.

**9. Black / White / Grey box:**  
- **Black**: No code/credentials (real attacker).  
- **White**: Full code & access.  
- **Grey**: Partial knowledge.

**10. Handling false positives:**  
- Re-test manually.  
- Correlate with logs & behavior.  
- Only escalate confirmed issues.

### **Advanced Security Concepts**

**11. Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption:**  
- Symmetric (AES): One key — fast, good for bulk data.  
- Asymmetric (RSA): Public/private — secure key exchange.

**12. TLS Handshake & vulnerabilities:**  
- Client/server agree protocol, exchange keys via asymmetric → switch to symmetric session.  
- Risks: SSL stripping, weak ciphers.  
- Use TLS 1.3 with modern cipher suites.

**13. Secure session management:**  
- Random IDs, rotate after privilege change.  
- Use Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies.  
- Expire on inactivity.

**14. Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing:**  
- Encryption: Reversible with key.  
- Encoding: Format for transport (Base64).  
- Hashing: One-way integrity (SHA-256).

**15. Least privilege principle:**  
- Assign minimal rights needed.  
- Reduces blast radius for compromise.

**16. JWT security:**  
- Sign with strong keys (HS256/RS256).  
- Short expiration, store securely, no sensitive payloads.

**17. MFA + bypass techniques:**  
- Combine password + OTP/device.  
- Bypass risk: SIM swap, OTP phishing.  
- Mitigate via phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2).

**18. Testing broken access control:**  
- Modify user IDs in URLs.  
- Try escalations without proper role tokens.

### **Scenario-Based Problem Solving**

**19. Security vs performance:**  
- Risk-based approach: focus on critical modules.  
- Use caching, optimize scans, shift-left security.

**20. Critical prod vulnerability:**  
- Isolate, mitigate, inform stakeholders, apply hotfix, post-mortem.

**21. Microservices testing strategy:**  
- Test each service API.  
- Use mTLS between services.  
- Scan container images & configs.

**22. New third-party library:**  
- Version & CVE check.  
- License compliance.  
- Sandbox test before adoption.

**23. STRIDE example:**  
- Banking app DFD — Spoofing (fake login), Tampering (transaction modification), etc.

**24. Risk prioritization:**  
- CVSS score, exploitability, business impact.

**25. Mobile banking threat modeling:**  
- Analyze data flow between app-server.  
- Threats: MITM, jailbreak/root access, local data storage.

***

### **Secure SDLC & DevSecOps**

**26. CI/CD integration:**  
- Run SAST/DAST in pipeline.  
- Parallel scans.  
- Break build on high-severity findings.

**27. Secure coding practices:**  
- Validate input, escape output, use prepared statements, least privilege.

**28. Shift-left security:**  
- Embed scans early in dev cycle.  
- Challenge: Dev resistance → Mitigation: training + automation.

**29. Compliance checks:**  
- Map requirements to controls.  
- Use compliance scanners (SonarQube rules, Security Hub).

***

### **Tools & Technologies**

**30. Preferred tools:**  
- Burp Suite (manual + automation), OWASP ZAP (free), SonarQube (code scans).

**31. Burp vs ZAP:**  
- Burp — richer pro features, more integrations.  
- ZAP — free, great for open-source adoption.

**32. Static analysis tools:**  
- Detect code flaws early.  
- Limitations: false positives, no runtime flaws.

**33. Nessus / Qualys experience:**  
- Used for infra scanning, patch prioritization.

***

### **Industry Knowledge**

**34. Current trends:**  
- API abuse, supply chain attacks, AI-driven phishing, cloud misconfigurations.

**35. Staying updated:**  
- CVE feeds, security blogs, conferences, exploit databases.

**36. Cloud-native app security:**  
- Secure containers, rotate secrets, apply least privilege IAM.

***

### **Behavioral**

**37. Challenging assessment:**  
- Found logic flaw letting payments bypass OTP.  
- Prioritized fix, retested, documented.

**38. Explaining to non-tech:**  
- Use business impact analogy (“like leaving vault unlocked”).

**39. Handling disagreements:**  
- Listen, explain risk in business terms, agree on minimal viable fix.

**40. Detecting missed vulnerability:**  
- Found hardcoded AWS keys in code review others skipped.

***

### **Practical Skills**

**41. SQLi script:**  
- Python + requests sending payloads, checking error keywords.

**42. Input validation (XSS prevention):**  
- Whitelist + HTML encoding output.

**43. Authentication bypass test:**  
- Modify JWT payload, replay sessions without auth, verify restricted access.

***

### **Client-Specific**

**44. Legacy system testing:**  
- Compensating controls, network segmentation, layered security.

**45. Industry-specific considerations:**  
- Finance → PCI-DSS compliance, encryption of PII.  
- Healthcare → HIPAA, data minimization.

**46. Practical recommendations:**  
- Ensure solutions are compatible with tech stack & business workflow.
