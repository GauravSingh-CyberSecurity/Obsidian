Are You Ready for HTB CBBH?

Reasons You’re Ready Now

1. Strong Foundations: Your background in networking, scripting, and VAPT aligns well with the core knowledge required for CBBH.


2. Hands-On Experience: Your work with Burp Suite, Python scripting, and identifying vulnerabilities shows you're already involved in bug hunting-related tasks.


3. Focus on Security: Your interest in transitioning to security testing aligns perfectly with the certification's objectives.



Reasons to Wait

1. Limited Web-Specific Experience: If you're not deeply familiar with web technologies like JavaScript, PHP, or the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, it might be worth spending 1–2 months mastering these.


2. Practical Bug Bounty Experience: Engaging in live bug bounty platforms (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd) could help you understand the practical aspect of bug hunting better.


3. Time Commitment: If your current schedule (10 AM – 8 PM job) leaves little time for consistent study, consider waiting until you're more available.

Recommendation

If you feel confident with OWASP Top 10, basic web application architecture, and tools like Burp Suite, you can start the CBBH now.

If not, spend 1–2 months:

Learn OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

Practice on platforms like PortSwigger Web Security Academy and Hack The Box Labs.

Try bug hunting on live platforms to gain more confidence.




---

Suggested Preparation Plan (2 Months)

1. Study Web Technologies:

Learn JavaScript, HTTP/HTTPS, and APIs.

Explore common web frameworks like PHP and Laravel.



2. Master Vulnerabilities:

Study the OWASP Top 10 and practice exploiting them in lab environments.



3. Hands-On Labs:

Practice on Hack The Box and TryHackMe.

Use PortSwigger Web Security Academy to master Burp Suite techniques.



4. Engage in Bug Bounty Platforms:

Join HackerOne or Bugcrowd to gain real-world experience.

Final Verdict

Based on your skills, you're almost ready for the CBBH. However, brushing up on web-specific knowledge and vulnerabilities for 1–2 months will ensure you're fully prepared to maximize the training and pass the certification successfully.

Let me know if you'd like resources or a detailed plan for preparation!










Before purchasing the HTB Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (CBBH) training, brushing up on the following tech stack and concepts will ensure you’re fully prepared to get the most out of the training program. Here’s a breakdown of the areas you should focus on, aligned with your existing skillset:

1. Web Technologies & Web Application Architecture

You need to be comfortable with the core technologies that power web applications. Since you're already familiar with networking and security concepts, enhancing your understanding of web technologies is crucial.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Learn how web pages are structured and styled (HTML/CSS).

JavaScript is key for client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS).

Focus Areas: DOM manipulation, event handling, JavaScript frameworks (like React or Angular, basic familiarity).


Backend Technologies:

PHP: Since you're working with Laravel (which uses PHP), understanding how PHP handles requests, sessions, and security is crucial.

Node.js / Express.js: If you’re dealing with REST APIs, knowing how backend frameworks work will help in identifying vulnerabilities.


RESTful APIs:

Learn how APIs work, their common authentication mechanisms (OAuth, API keys), and potential weaknesses like IDOR or JWT flaws.


Web Security (OWASP Top 10):

Brush up on common web vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Broken Authentication and Session Management

Sensitive Data Exposure





---

2. Burp Suite & Web Application Testing

Burp Suite Pro: You're already familiar with Burp Suite, but ensure you’re skilled in using all its features, particularly for bug bounty hunting:

Intercepting traffic and analyzing HTTP requests.

Using Intruder, Repeater, and Scanner.

Identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).


Web Application Testing Techniques:

Learn Fuzzing, Brute Force techniques, and how to use Burp Extensions.

Familiarize yourself with Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and how to bypass them.




---

3. Linux & Command-Line Skills

Since you are comfortable with Linux:

Make sure you’re proficient in:

File permissions, bash scripting, and command-line tools like curl, wget, netcat, and nmap for web application testing.

Tools like Nikto, Gobuster, and Hydra for brute-forcing and vulnerability scanning.




---

4. Vulnerability Exploitation and Exploitation Frameworks

Metasploit: Brush up on using Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.

Manual Exploitation: Strengthen your manual testing skills (e.g., exploiting command injection, file upload flaws, path traversal).



---

5. Authentication & Authorization

Since authentication is often the weak link in web applications:

Learn about common authentication mechanisms and authorization flaws:

Session management issues (cookies, JWT, etc.)

Insecure password storage, broken multi-factor authentication (MFA).




---

6. Bug Bounty Platforms & Practices

Bug Bounty Methodology:

Learn how HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and similar platforms operate. Understand how to submit bugs, write clear reports, and adhere to ethical guidelines.


Test Target Selection:

How to choose which target to focus on (prioritize critical vulnerabilities).

Read previous reports on platforms like HackerOne to learn the most common vulnerabilities.




---

7. Cloud Security (Optional but Beneficial)

If you’ll be dealing with cloud-based applications:

Learn the basics of AWS (which you might already have exposure to):

EC2, S3, IAM roles, and security configurations.

Learn how to test cloud-native apps for vulnerabilities.




---

Additional Focus Areas:

Exploit Writing: If you're aiming for advanced-level exploitation, brushing up on writing payloads or exploits for vulnerabilities is a good practice.

Fuzzing Tools: Familiarize yourself with fuzzing tools like AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) for web apps.



---

Recommended Tech Stack to Brush Up On

Programming: Python (for automation), JavaScript (web app vulnerabilities), PHP (Laravel).

Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST APIs, PHP/Node.js.

Security Tools: Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nikto, Gobuster, Hydra, Nmap.

Cloud Security (if applicable): AWS basics.

Bug Bounty Platforms: HackerOne, Bugcrowd.



---

Actionable Plan (2 months before registration)

Week 1-2: Focus on web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), API basics, and understanding common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).

Week 3-4: Deep dive into Burp Suite and practice common vulnerabilities.

Week 5-6: Practice using tools like Metasploit, Nikto, and Gobuster for web app exploitation.

Week 7-8: Engage in bug bounty programs and read real-world reports to see how vulnerabilities are identified and reported.



---

Conclusion

Based on your current skillset, you're already in a strong position for CBBH training. Focus on refining your web application security knowledge (OWASP vulnerabilities, PHP, JavaScript, and REST APIs) and Burp Suite. You should be well-prepared to start the training program soon, but brushing up on these areas will enhance your chances of success.
