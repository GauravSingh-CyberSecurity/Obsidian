**BBP(bug bounty programs) & VDP(vulnerability disclosure programs) : 
(find programs with very big attack surface as a beginner)** 
DOD(Department of defense, of any country), IBM, Ford, Gm , 

Hackerone programs: https://hackerone.com/directory/programs 

VDP: are good for beginners as a playground because its not paying so top hackers don't work there
They're really, really good playground for you to learn and also understand what vulnerability types

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,110
are more of your interests.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,360
You can also use this to get better on certain topics or subjects that you may be struggling with.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,210
So I highly recommend finding these and looking at them.

1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,550
Selecting your first target could also be a very confusing process if you're very, very you bug hunting.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,440
I highly recommend looking at bug bounty programs, vulnerability disclosure programs like the DOD,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,690
GM, Ford, IBM and other programs that have a very huge attack surface where you get to practice all

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,260
your different skill sets and really get better at building your own methodology.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,940
So let's look at some of these programs.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,040
The first one would be the Department of Defense.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,920
And we're going to look for the Department of Defense.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,100
As you can see, this program has been around for a very long time.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,260
But if we look at those stats that we talked about earlier right here, you can see that they have had

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,840
a ton of reports, 13000 reports have been resolved and their scope is massive.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,710
This is because they have everything that's owned by the DOD.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,210
So any military website and any of the Department of Defense websites are included in this bookbinding

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,720
program.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,940
And each of those assets have hundreds of subdomains.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,610
So you get to really experience with it and build a methodology that's really, really important to

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,200
find a program that's appealing to you.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,180
Say the Department of Defense isn't for you.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,390
Other options like IBM, where it's also similar to that they have every IBM product, every IBM website

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,310
and any IBM tokens are secrets.

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,960
So keep that in mind that when they put a star before a domain name means everything they own under

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,630
that domain.

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,770
So looking at just IBM, they're a huge target.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,690
And this allows you to find some complex subdomains that haven't been looked by other hackers.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,400
There's an wive on the social programs that are good asset to new hackers is because the competition

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,090
is a lot less.

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,320
As you can see, a lot of hackers that are hacking on here that found a lot of reports, but a lot of

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,730
the top hackers who are focused on creating bounties that are focusing on these programs because it's

28
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,360
not paying.

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,280
They're really, really good playground for you to learn and also understand what vulnerability types

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,110
are more of your interests.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,360
You can also use this to get better on certain topics or subjects that you may be struggling with.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,210
So I highly recommend finding these and looking at them.

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,240
We can also do bug bounties.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,670
These are programs that offer a bounty so you can click ah here again.

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,180
We're talking about this in our other videos on how to use Haku one.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,320
If you scroll right here, there are programs like Verizon Media which have a very massive scope and

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,960
you can see they pay upwards of ten thousand dollars for critical.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,820
If you scroll down, we can still see that in the last 90 days I've had almost five hundred reports

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,020
received over half a million dollars paid in the last 90 days.

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,460
But also, if you scroll down, you can see a lot of tough hackers.

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,180
There's a lot of eyes on these programs because, one, they're public, too.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,130
They are very, very popular because of how much they pay and also anything being they have a huge,

43
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,870
massive scope.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
So a lot of more hackers are going to look at it.

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm not saying this to discourage you and say that you're not going to find a vulnerability if you have

46
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,130
some experience or confidence in your skill sets.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,840
I highly recommend going for this.

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,430
It may take you a while to find your first bug, but once you find that first vulnerability report and

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,650
get paid, it's all downhill from there.

50
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,430
It's going to be great.

51
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,220
You're going to be able to find more and it becomes easier.

52
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,690
Also, if you're not really into hacking on a platform, you want to try something that's not on a platform

53
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,860
like Hacker one or background.

54
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,050
You can go to Facebook dot com, slash White-Out.

55
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,740
I think that you might be required to be logged on a Facebook account.

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,220
But right here you can also see Facebook also has a massive program.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,920
Facebook itself is a massive application.

58
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,780
They're deploying new code every day.

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,600
But on top of that, not only Facebook, but Internet, Digg, Oculus, Instagram, WhatsApp and Portal

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,090
are also a part of their bug bounty program.

61
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,500
So I highly recommend checking these out.

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,740
Also, Google and Apple have their own Bargnani programs off the platform.

63
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,480
And last but not least, also, Microsoft is a really, really good place to start because of how massive

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,350
the applications are.

65
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,000
I keep mentioning massive applications and massive companies and why they're a better choice for started

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,420
hackers.

67
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,830
This is for multiple reasons.

68
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,260
The first thing being that one is a when there's a massive company, they're shipping code regularly

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,840
for companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, they're constantly creating new products, new functionality

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,180
for their websites, and they're pushing these codes every week.

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,380
There's always room for more mistake on the developer ends where bug bounty hunters could be able to

72
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,340
identify those and get some bounties or find vulnerabilities to report to.

73
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,380
And it's also very, very important to find a program that you really become familiar with.

74
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,530
And you also continuously Hakone, as you get better, this helps you focus on different vulnerability

75
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:10,830
types.

76
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,040
My recommendation is to find a wannabe that looks appealing to you.

77
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,470
Focus on that for a few weeks, master.

78
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,230
It set a goal that you're going to find five six.

79
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,670
However number is comfortable for you.

80
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,050
Find out many vulnerabilities.

81
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,640
First, move on to the next one.

82
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,560
While you're looking at the next vulnerability.

83
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,970
You have some of these other ones under your belt where you can rely on your skills and saying, I'm

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,440
comfortable if we're looking for these while I focus on this new bug type that I want to get better

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,090
at and combining all of them.

86
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,010
So you're finding reports that are within your skill sets while you're learning and learning new skills

87
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,990
that could help you with your background, your journey.
