**BEING AND NOTHINGNESS**
[ by Jean-Paul Sartre (1943) ]
A book by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre that explores existentialism, consciousness, and the nature of freedom.


"The essence of Dasein lies in its existence."
-**Martin Heidegger**


## EXISTENTIALISM IS A HUMANISM.                   (An Essay by Jean-Paul Sartre)


**EXISTENTIALISM**
A philosophical movement that explores the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

"My purpose here is to offer a defence of existentialism against several reproaches that have been laid against it. First, it has been reproached as an invitation to people to dwell in quietism of despair."

"From another quarter we are reproached for having underlined all that is ignominious in the human situation..."

"For since we ignore the commandments of God and all values prescribed as eternal, nothing remains but what is strictly voluntary. Everyone can do what he likes, and will be incapable, from such a point of view, of condemning either the point of view or the action of anyone else."


**DOGMATISM**
An expression of a belief or opinion as if it were a fact.
Often compared to stubbornness or narrow mindedness.

"What they have in common is simply the fact that they believe that existence comes before essence - or, if you will, that we must begin from the subjective."


The conception in the mind of the artisan, the paperknife maker, is the essence of what is to be a paperknife.


# ( Essence precedes existence. )
In essence, anything that exists, the essence of that thing was conceptualized before it came into existence.
Eg: A bulb, before even a bulb was created, it's essence was conceptualized by its creator. The creator first conceptualized that they want to bring in existence an electrical tool that can emit light, which must help humans to see at night. Then the engineering of the Bulb started and it was bought into existence.



"Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it...If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing."


"Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills, and as he conceives himself after already existing - as he wills to be after that leap towards existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself."

"Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism."

"Thus, the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders."

"And, when we say that man is responsible for himself, we do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for all men."

"Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of the individual subject and, on the other, that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity.

It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism. When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men."

"All the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be... Our responsibility is thus much greater than we had supposed, for it concerns mankind as a whole."

"When a man commits himself to anything, fully realising that he is not only choosing what he will be, but is thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind - in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility. There are many, indeed, who show no such anxiety. But we affirm that they are merely disguising their anguish or are in flight from it."


**ABRAHAM AND ISAAC**
The story of Abraham and Isaac appears in Genesis 22, where God tests Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, at Moriah.

In the Bible, Abraham is portrayed as a righteous man who is committed to God, compassionate, hospitable, and a man of peace. But In reality he is not righteous because he shifts responsibility of his actions on God and says God asked me to give the most unspeakable sacrifice, and he doesn't even question it. And How does he even know that the voice he heard is of God?


"And when we speak of "abandonment" - a favorite word of Heidegger - we only mean to say that God does not exist...There can no longer be any good a priori, since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it. It is nowhere written that 'the good' exists, that one must be honest or must not lie, since we are now upon the plane where there are only men. Dostoevsky once wrote: 'If God did not exist, everything would be permitted'..."


"...man is free, man is freedom. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. - We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free."

## THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS                         [A philosophical essay by Albert Camus ]
(published in 1942)

**SISYPHUS**
A figure from Greek mythology who is condemned for all eternity to roll a boulder up a mountain, only to watch it roll back down again as soon as he reaches the peak.


"The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor."

"This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. ...one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone...the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down..."

## "... he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock."


"If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious."

"The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd."

"If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy...There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth."

"All Sisyphus' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him... **==One must imagine Sisyphus happy.==** "


"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."

To ask ;
**Why Live? | Why not commit suicide?** Same thing.
They both are the same Question, but just with a shift in perspective!

**Why live?** : takes you towards creating your own meaning, purpose and commitment. It moves you towards taking the Fate you were given, and committing to that fate. Calling it "My fate"; "My carrer"; "My family" ; "My life"

**Why not commit suicide?** Takes you towards, nihilism, what is the meaning, saying the existence and life in itself is meaningless so everything that is, was and ever will be is all totally absurd. Because one day all will be dead and gone and forgotten.


Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were both leftists and existentialists.

==**Being willing to accept full responsibility for who you are , that is what an authentic human being will do.**==

But what most of the human beings do is want to shift that responsibility elsewhere, saying and even believing things like"God made me this way!" ; "society made me this way" ; I couldn't help it , my wrong doings are not because of me it's because so and so made me do it.

For **Exesitentialism** This is like it's first commandment: "you are responsible, and you step up to that responsibility or you don't "


How do you know the voice you think you hearing is the voice of God? And not of your own paranoid self or even the voices of bad spirits?

And then why should you not Questions these voices in your head , that are asking you to make the greatest sacrifices, why should you obey these voices if you do not know for sure it's the voice of God?

If I just obey without asking questions and not knowing the reason for the action I am doing or am supposed to do, I shift responsibility to someone else, "someone told me to do it, someone else made me do it"

But we are in that circumstances and we don't know what the right thing to do is, But we have to do something and we have to take full responsibility for it.

It is nowhere written that the good exists. Not in the mind of God, not in platonic forms, not built into the structure of nature. There is no True standards of Good and Bad.

So even if God exists or does not exists. Everything is permitted.

Even if God told you to do something, you still have choice to do it or not. And if he doesn't exists then there is no one to obey anyways.
So whatever you choose it's totally your responsibility and no one else's.
That is why:-
"...man is free, man is freedom. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. - We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that **man is condemned to be free**."


That is the wonderful , rhetorical , paradoxical Truth of human beings:
"We are free, and we cannot escape the fact that we are free." That is what it is to be a human being, a choosing being.
A pure potential that can go anywhere, and any attempts to escape that is an irresponsiblity, you have to accept it.

The absurdity of existence is there lies no inherent meaning to life. The meaning of life lies in what we give to it.
So you can't find purpose or meaning of life, you have to create it in life.

 You give life meaning by embracing the fate you’ve been given and making it your own. Meaning comes when you choose to commit—to say, “This is my fate, and I accept it,” “This is my family, and I stand by them,” or “This is not just a job, but my career, and I dedicate myself to it.” It’s a shift in perspective: instead of seeing life as an absurd, meaningless journey destined to fade into nothingness, you begin to see it as your own personal path. By willingly committing to what you must do in life and making it truly yours, you find purpose. In that commitment, you discover joy and fulfillment—not because the task changes, but because your perspective do.
 
**==You have to will yourself into joy.==**

**THE WOMEN ARE UP TO SOMETHING**

By Benjamin J.B. Lipscomb (2021)

Chronicles the captivating story of four intellectual giants Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley, and Iris Murdoch - who profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy.




**METAETHICS**
Analytical philosophy's field of metaethics investigates the standing, origins, and applicability of moral principles, attributes, and terminology.




**IMMANUEL KANT**
German philosopher (1724-1804)

One of the central Enlightenment thinkers. Well known for his works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics.



**What have the men been up to?**

Faith in God? (Religions)

Duties from noumenal? (Kant)

Power instinct? ('Nietzsche')

Subjective commitment? (Sartre)






**UTILITARIANISM**

A tradition of ethical philosophy, championed by British thinkers Bentham and Mill, that judges actions by their ability to create happiness for the greatest number of people.





"While it is true that science cannot decide questions of value, that is because they cannot be intellectually decided at all, and lie outside the realm of truth and falsehood."




"While it is true that science cannot decide questions of value, that is because they cannot be intellectually decided at all, and lie outside the realm of truth and falsehood. Whatever knowledge is attainable, must be attained by scientific methods; and what science cannot discover, mankind cannot know."
-Bertrand Russell






**RUDOLF CARNAP**
German-language philosopher (1891-1970)

Carnap's work significantly influenced analytic philosophy, a dominant school of thought in the 20th century.






"logical analysis yields the negative result that the alleged statements in this domain are entirely meaningless."
- Rudolf Carnap




**MAX HORKHEIMER**
German philosopher and sociologist (1895-1973)

A leader of the "Frankfurt School", a group of philosophers and social scientists.




"Since ends are no longer determined in the light of reason, it is also impossible to say that one economic or political system, no matter how cruel and despotic, is less reasonable than another."
-Max Horkheimer





"It is now pretty generally accepted by professional philosophers that ultimate ethical principles must be arbitrary."
-Brian Medlin




"In the courses on moral philosophy we analyze ethical judgments and show that they are cognitively meaningless or that they are equivalent to imperative sentences or to reports on one's emotional state."
-Ernest Moody




**THE TROLLEY PROBLEM**

A sequence of psychological and ethical thought experiments featuring stylized moral problems requiring the decision of whether to sacrifice one person in order to save several.





# WHAT FACTS GIVE RISE TO ETHICS?



**THE OBJECTIVIST ETHICS**
Human good does not require human sacrifices and cannot be achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone.




**VALUES**
Ethics and social sciences use "value" to judge what matters most, guiding our actions and understanding the weight of different choices.




"What is morality, or ethics? It is a code of values to guide man's choices and actions-the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. Ethics, as a science, deals with discovering and defining such a code."
-Ayn Rand



"The first question that has to be answered, as a precondition of any attempt to define, to judge or to accept any specific system of ethics, is: Why does man need a code of values?"
-Ayn Rand



"What is morality, or ethics? It is a code of values to guide man's choices and actions-the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. Ethics, as a science, deals with discovering and defining such a code."
-Ayn Rand



"Is ethics the province of whims: of personal emotions, social edicts and mystic revelations or is it the province of reason? Is ethics a subjective luxury-or an objective necessity?"
-Ayn Rand



"The concept "value" is not a primary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible."
-Ayn Rand




"I quote from Galt's speech: "There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or nonexistence and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms."
-Ayn Rand



"It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action."
-Ayn Rand




"An organism's life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needs from the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body, the action of using that fuel properly."
-Ayn Rand




"What standard determines what is proper in this context? The standard is the organism's life, or: that which is required for the organism's survival."
-Ayn Rand




"If an amoeba's protoplasm stops assimilating food, or if a man's heart stops beating-the organism dies. In a fundamental sense, stillness is the antithesis of life."
-Ayn Rand



"Metaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action. Epistemologically, the concept of "value" is genetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of 'life."
-Ayn Rand




"In answer to those philosophers who claim that no relation can be established between ultimate ends or values and the facts of reality, let me stress that the fact that living entities exist and function necessitates the existence of values and of an ultimate value which for any given living entity is its own life."
-Ayn Rand




**David Hume**
(Scottish philosopher and historian)

Best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism.






"The fact that a living entity is, determines what it ought to do. So much for the issue of the relation between 'is' and 'ought'."
-Ayn Rand


Aside from biological differences, the main difference between humans and other animal species is the ability of complex reasoning, use of complex language, and introspection.



**PHILIPPA FOOT**
English Philosopher (1920-2010)

One of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics and is remembered for her work on moral reasoning and the famous "trolley problem" thought experiment.


"...the evaluation of human action depends... on essential features of specifically human life."
-Philippa Foot




"It is necessary for plants to have water, for birds to build nests, for wolves to hunt in packs, and for lionesses to teach their cubs to kill."
-Philippe Foot




"Like lionesses, human parents are defective if they do not teach their young the skills that they need to survive."
-Philippa Foot




"By 'grammar,' Foot means the logical connections among a certain class of judgments."
-Micah Lott



# VIRTUE ETHICS

"Virtues play a necessary part in the life of human beings as do stings in the life of bees."
-Philippa Foot



"We start from the fact that it is the particular life form of a species of plant or animal that determines how an individual plant or animal should be."
-Philippa Foot



"And all the truths about what this or that characteristic does, what it's purpose or point is, and in suitable cases its function, must be related to this life cycle. The way an individual should be is determined by what is needed for development, self-maintenance, and reproduction."
-Philippa Foot



"Human beings are creatures with power to recognize reasons for action and act upon them... Animals go for the good thing that they see."
-Philippa Foot




"In spite of the diversity of human goods-the elements that can make up good human lives-it is therefore possible that the concept of a good human life plays the same part in determining goodness of human characteristics and operations that the concept of flourishing plays in the determination of goodness in plants and animals. So far the conceptual structure seems to be intact."
-Philippa Foot



" [Foot]... believes plants and animals can possess or lack a kind of intrinsic goodness, what she calls 'natural goodness', which hinges upon their flourishing and the qualities essential to such flourishing."
-John Lemos





**THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS**
A book by Aristotle that explores the science of the good for human life, that which is the goal or end at which all our actions aim.




Ethics is about principles.

Naturalist, Objectivist ethics integrates:

1. Principles: Explicit, rational, general, abstract, based upon identifying

2. Survival needs

3. Identified resources

4. Character dispositions to think/feel/act

5. Actions intentional behaviors, habits

6. Consequences: effects of actions








# OBJECTIVITY OF SCIENCE


**SPACE RACE**
The 1960s space race saw the USSR launch Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space, in 1961, prompting the US to respond with John Glenn's historic Earth orbit later that year, fueling a fierce competition in space exploration.



**EPISTEMOLOGY**
The area of philosophy concerned with the nature of knowledge, its sources and assumptions, its scope, and its validity.



**THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD**
- Observation
- Hypothesis
- Prediction
- Experimentation
- Analysis
- Conclusion & Communication
