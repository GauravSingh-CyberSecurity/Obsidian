Hello dear diary 

So it's been a while since I wrote anything, I think its time I restart this, 

I lie here trying to understand things and Learn myself, so maybe I will start writing down my thoughts and feelings here so that later on maybe I can reassess them, study myself a little better.

I haven't done this in a while so I am a little rusty, please bear with me, 

Let here not be any judgement, conclusion but just curiosity and learning about my own being, my thoughts and mind.

Talking about it , I am trying to know my own mind a little better, make a friend of it , we sit together in solitude and communicate for hours, I have been reading other people's work so that I can learn easily what people labour hard there life to find out .

So this is how I will do this, I will be putting these diary entries throughout the day whenever I realise I need to write some feelings, thoughts or moments down to savour it , so that I can revisit it, so that it doesn't gets cloudy with time .

Okay then we'll meet again..


I am trying to do so many things, I plan - visualise and everything but I am nearly scared to death to start.
I am even more afraid of staying at the same place it's a real dark place to be

I feel paralyzed that I can't move my mind goes numb through the shear force of fear of change, I need to calm myself. This is because I am so afraid of failing at things or finding out that I am just not good enough.

My conscience grows deeper by the day and I feel everything so very deeply that it causes me to suffer, this pain seems to be unbearable and sometimes it overwhelms my whole being, and I see everyone around me so blisfully ignorant to the fiber of consciousness around them, and it makes me remember this quote 

"Blessed are the forgetful for they get better even of off there blunders"

To be clear I am not complaining about my mind, it's not just these things there I also have a very beautiful place in there a lot of good and positive thoughts, memories.
And I have developed some tools to evolve every day as a human being try to better understand my mind and have compassion and love for its complexities and imperfections.


I can't always stay in my mind, too much I seem to ignore the present 
I find myself in this dilemma where I am trying to be more aware by practicing deeper thinking and I find myself to swallowed up in my mind such that I seem to ignore things in plain sight in the present,

Maybe I should assign a proper timeframe of my day just for reflection on my thoughts.

Here's a thought : "stop breaking promises to yourself "



## **12 October 2024**

I have the ability to concentrate and I am willing to give my life for another person , that Is compassion.

When you become a parent of a child you are unique, irreplaceable you are the only one who is actually the father or the mother of that child, that knowledge gives your life a meaning a purpose that the child needs you and your love and no one can replace it, similarly it goes for a persons work that is unique and that no one else can take up from the middle without any guidance or help by the owner. That gives a person, purpose as well.
This fact makes you realise that we all as individuals are expected something from this life, even in the moments when we may think that now we don't expect anything from life and have lost the will to live.

When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.”

there are two races of men in this world, but only these two—the “race” of the decent man and the “race” of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of “pure race”—
Also a man canot just be a decent man to be counted as a good man.
A man should be decent as well as intelligent enough to be aware of his actions and understand the consequences of his actions.

If not then maybe even a decent man can be tricked into doing evil things if he might be led to believe that he is doing that evil act for a good purpose.


I want to be a student of life and learn consciously, purposefully. I will shape my own thoughts, mind , being and beliefs. I will learn , understand and assess things with help of the mechanisms I have build up my self or tools I have picked up from someone else by choice.
I will live my life and make my decision and beliefs on my own consciencios choice, 
And I will refrain from thinking, believing, learning, growing and developing my theories, beliefs, philosophy, principles and life on an autopilot mode.

I will not live, learn life as it comes at me like in a reactive manner,
I will get ready and train for life, so that when life comes at me every day I have a response that I want to give back to it, instead of a reaction that is expected to come out of me.

This weekend I was able to get back in touch with my individuality and spend time in solitude with myself, meditating, reading, self reflecting , learning about myself, finding my individuality seeing my own self more clear and being friends with my mind.

As we live our lives we existing in a two roles Simultaneously , as a teacher and a student.
For if you don't pass on what you have learned to someone else it will be lost and will have no meaning.
And if you don't keep learning, it's most probable that what I know today is not the whole truth and if I don't keep on learning I might never know or will never find it, and supposedly even if my knowledge is relevant today if I stop learning things I know today will probably become insignificant tomorrow and I will be left with a false sense of knowledge and trust and will find myself wrapped up in my ego trying to prove that I am still relevant.

There is this metaphor that
Every man has 3 hearts 
One in his mouth, for the world to know..
Another in his chest, just for his friends..
And a secret heart buried deep where no one can find it.

you can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget how to make the most of where you are.



If a genius like Nikola Tesla or Vincent van Gogh can die penny less thinking that there life was a failure not knowing the impact they did to this world
How can I expect anything from this world, how can I dare to think that I am entitled to status, money, position and power. All I have with myself is my actions and choice, the work I do, the relationships I build with people (family, friends, lovers) and the service I give to this world.

I want to be the same man with or without all the money, position, status and other things that the world has to offer to a man , I would like to be a good man and even if achivement and failures change me I want to change in a good way and become a better person with time.
This is the human experience I want to have from this life.




The depth of my consciousness causes me to suffer. Is it a blessing or a curse to feel everything soo deeply?

The only way out is through, you take more of the things that poisons you until you turn into a tonic that girdles(form a cover around the world, like a belt is covered around your waist) the world around you "

 You may curse your blessing but your blessing is never a curse. I'd rather feel everything all at once than not feel anything at all

And make sure You come out with the same men you went in with.

Even though I can be aggressive I am capable of being tamed into an intimate relationship.

The writer Jean Piaget discusses the last stage of adolescent, he calls it messaianic stage. He says that this is a stage where, when you are making that transition from the group identity that you are chasing as a teenager to becoming an individual trying not to get lost into a group identity as an adult , so you try to choose a path of heroics but you need to be very careful on choosing your purpose in this or you may get caught up in chasing a wrong agenda.

I can say that this is the transition that I am making right now in my life and should be very aware of this fact, while I try to find my individuality.

I must make sure to think complexly and build my philosophies and my own individual beliefs in very sophisticated manner in order to develop my wisdom.

This world throws many different narratives and theories at you, trying to think we are overpopulated, we are like a cancer to this world and all negative sorts.
Like tyrannical utopian globalist who spread this narratives that we need to sacrifice the poor, send them to there deaths to reduce the population for saving the planet, and people seem to believe it.
Not seeing that the hidden motives behind these narratives is the alternative agenda of gaining more power, power over deciding who lives and who dies , trying to play god for their own convenience and the middle class still believes it because they think the guy that has more money is probably right.
And this kinds of narratives don't even get challenged because, well the people in middle of the pyramid who can actually make a challenge thinks it's not me who is being sacrificed and the one who is, has no voice in the structure of the society so the top of the pyramid gets even more power and control.

Take the path of struggle, acknowledging and studying the complex problems and do a differential analysis instead of chasing a cheap moral virtue that is sold out to you.

Educate yourself and stand in opposition of these ideas that are products of deep rooted narcissism

**The Dark Triad** consists of three interrelated personality traits:

**Narcissism**: Characterized by grandiosity, entitlement, and a lack of empathy. Narcissists often seek admiration and can be sensitive to criticism, masking underlying insecurities with an inflated self-image.

**Machiavellianism**: Involves manipulation and exploitation of others for personal gain. Machiavellians are emotionally cold, often using charm and deceit to achieve their goals while lacking genuine empathy.

**Psychopathy**: Defined by impulsivity, callousness, and a lack of remorse. Psychopaths are often charming but can engage in harmful behaviors without regard for others' feelings.

**Sadism**: people who take delight in causing pain to others.




The **Big Five Personality Traits**, often referred to as the OCEAN model, consist of:

1. **Openness to Experience**: This trait involves imagination, curiosity, and a willingness to explore new ideas. High scorers are creative and open-minded, while low scorers prefer routine and familiarity.

2. **Conscientiousness**: Reflects how organized and goal-oriented an individual is. High conscientiousness indicates reliability and diligence, whereas low levels may suggest impulsivity and carelessness.

3. **Extraversion**: Measures sociability and assertiveness. Extraverts are outgoing, energetic, and thrive in social situations, while introverts may feel drained by social interactions.

4. **Agreeableness**: Indicates how compassionate and cooperative a person is. High agreeableness suggests a tendency to be trusting and altruistic, while low agreeableness can lead to skepticism and competitiveness.

5. **Neuroticism**: Assesses emotional stability. Individuals high in neuroticism may experience anxiety and mood swings, while those low in this trait tend to be calm and resilient.

To put the sadistic narcissistic aggressive men , you have to be a non narcissistic aggressive men.

What keeps a dialogue among men civilized is that it won't be so civilized if the dialogue go too sideways 


It's morally incumbent for all of us to set up our lives so that we can afford to tell the truth and can't be taken out easily by a tyranny.

It means you should have multiple sources of income set up so that even if your bosses don't like you speaking the truth you are not shunned by them.


I think,
The purpose of marriage is to facilitate a long term psychological and spiritual development of two people, and create an establishment to provide an environment for children to flourish.

> "There is an old saying: 'That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' I don't believe that. I think the things that try to kill you make you angry and sad. Strength comes from the good things: your family, your friends, the satisfaction of hard work. Those are the things that will keep you whole. Those are the things to hold onto when you are broken." 


Figure out what's important to you. Know yourselves... and know what's right. Don't be swayed by fear or history or the opinions of outsiders. Find your own truth.


It's hard not to hate. People, things, institutions. When they break your spirit and take pleasure in watching you bleed... hate is the only feeling that makes sense. But I know what hate does to a man. Tears him apart. Turns him into something he's not.


You reach an age where you realize being a man isn’t about respect or strength, it’s about being aware of all the things you touch.


It's a paradox yet true That the more we learn the more ignorant we
become in the absolute sense


Every day is a new box. You open it, you take a look at what’s inside. You’re the one who determines if it’s a gift…or a coffin.


Out of all the man's miseries the most bitter is this, "to know so much, and to control so little"


In my pursuit of knowledge, I find myself increasingly aware of my own ignorance, yet paradoxically more oblivious to the ignorance that pervades those around me.


Life is a dance you pickup little dance moves from every step of your life and learn this dance of life and in the end make your own moves to leave behind for other's who are to come after you are gone



I don't want a successful life I want a life of significance


whatever happens tomorrow we have had today.


unfortunately people don't not look for the best in trouble times but rather the loudest


who you are is defined by what you are willing to struggle for


i don't have any extraordinary talent
i am just passionately curious


when you think you are gonna die yesterday,
today is sweet
so hang in there,
lose your shit tomorrow
today's no day to fall apart


go in search of life
and life will find you the love you seek


what does it benifits a man if he gain the world but looses his soul


Don't be like mediocre people who have become sedated and comfortably numb  they have forgotten their dream's and have forgotten that they have forgotten about their dream's . You must pay attention and work towards your dream to become great.


Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even off there blunders 
-nietzsche


Duty is sacrifice it eclipses all things even blood all men of honour must pay its price 


The reason of my ignorance is fear
The fear of what I might find if I paid attention
But it's okay to have fear, it's how I face this fear must define me as a man
This fear is how I become brave and courageous 






In this world that is deprived of hope and corrupted with hate

Love is a virtue worth struggling for,
It's hard to love and struggle for it, than giving in to the hate around us and becoming the vector for hate ourselves.



Better to know you're bad for a season,
Instead of pretending to be good for a lifetime 




I want to be so strong that I am capable of being gentle, humble and good

'cause a weak man can't be any of those things he's not gentle but soft, he's weak not humble and he's harmless not good 



The most important light is 
..the light you cannot see



Take action no matter how frightened you are.



**Victor Frankl on: how to practice Paradoxical Intention to tackle your Fear:-**
Instead of trying to eliminate fear, paradoxical intention suggests that individuals should wish for the very thing they fear, thereby reducing the pressure associated with it.

Key Concepts of Paradoxical Intention
1)Facing Fear Head-On:
Rather than avoiding anxiety-inducing situations, individuals are encouraged to embrace and exaggerate their fears. For example, someone with a fear of public speaking might be advised to intentionally try to stutter or sweat excessively during a presentation

2)Humor and Detachment: A significant aspect of this technique is the ability to detach from one’s fears and view them with humor.

1) If you can think, speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way. That's why you learn to write. It's because there is nothing more powerful than someone who can articulate and think. Writing forces you to think and organize your thoughts clearly
2) One of the things that’s absolutely crucial about writing is that it helps you think and it helps you think through a problem. And the more you practice writing, the clearer your thinking becomes.
3) Writing is not just a matter of putting down what you already know. Writing is a way of discovering what you don’t know, and clarifying what you do know.
4) Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. To be able to communicate your thoughts effectively and persuasively through writing is one of the most important skills you can develop
5) You learn to write so that people can understand you, but you also learn to write so that you can understand yourself. The act of writing forces you to organize your thoughts into a coherent narrative.
6) Writing is the most demanding form of thinking. It requires that you think so clearly that you put your thoughts into a form that other people can understand and that will move them. That’s a powerful thing.
7) the best thing you can do for yourself is learn how to write. Because every career you’ll ever have will require you to be able to communicate. And there’s no better way to hone your communication skills than by writing.



You have got a heavy load of suffering to bear and a heavy load of it is going to be unjust, so what are you gonna do about it. Accept it voluntarily and try to transform as a consequence.



The consequences of not talking is that you fight.


The institutions try to put a narrative on your mind , that you should think a certain way if you are a certain person.
Well fuck that, I'll let my thoughts be free even of me, my prejudices, my beliefs, my principles and my philosophies.
I'll take my thoughts and analyse them to understand it and shape my beliefs from the process of complex thinking and analysis of thoughts and points.

But I'll never put my thoughts in a cage for my thoughts are my mind.




This is how personality of a person evolves during there lifetime:

First you are a child , an infant dependent on its parent, them you join a group and find your tribe like in sports, songs, studies etc .
Then you evolve from being a tribal , a group entity to an individual, and you achieve your own individualism.


Learn about maturity, trust and responsibilities.




Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
And this whole world relies on kindness of a stranger.

I am a man of conscience.


Three ways you can find meaning in life or the things that actually give meaning to life:
1) in **your work**
2) **Love**
3) **Suffering**: (*`Most important, however, is this third point to meaning in life`*) i.e a person who is suffering can take the suffering and change his whole being around using that suffering. 
    That is the person is proud of his suffering and takes his suffering head on it gives him meaning.
    Even though the person suffers, they are proud that they suffer and become stronger and better this is the meaning of that suffering.
    To come out better, stronger, wiser and turn your whole life around. Perfect example is "David gogins ".


suffering is unavoidable. If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its cause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic.
If, on the other hand, one cannot change a situation that causes his suffering, he can still choose his attitude.

the priority stays with creatively changing the situation that causes us to suffer. But the superiority goes to the “know-how to suffer,” if need be.


extreme challenges are a means to explore one's potential and push beyond limits, its not for the sake of suffering.  "performing without purpose," focusing on self-improvement rather than seeking pain for its own sake.
You should be driven by a desire to better understand and strengthen your mind through suffering and reaching extremes.   
             -David Gogins.



All the meaning you'll need to get you through the hard times of your life is going to be a consequence of adoption responsibility and its not in , impulsive freedom (i.e having freedom of doing things impulsively).

You take care of yourself, you take care of your intimate partner , you take care of your damm family, you don't run off.
You take care of your community.
You rescue the wisdom from the past.
You stand up straight, you be courageous despite of the fact that life is tragic and tainted by malevolence.



Meek will not inherit the world. But 
Those who have swords, and known how to use them .
But keeps them sheathed will inherit the world.

You should be a monster, an absolute monster. And then you should learn how to control it.

It's better to be a warrior at a garden, then being a Gardner at war.


Sometimes you gotta be a lion so you can be the lamb you really are”
**-Dave Chappelle


To be a winner, you have to be deciplined, you have to know what you're doing and then you have to be on the edge, where you are being in a good enough level of challenge and your skills are being developed by overcoming challenges.
And where lossing is a good enough possibility.
Because otherwise you are not pushing yourself beyond your capacity.


# 24-October-2024

Fighting is just an outcome of not communicating. You should always choose to talk things out instead of choosing to fight, and if the hate seems so much even then try to take the route of negotiations via speaking.
For when enough people choose to fight instead to talk , you have world wars, good men killing good men not knowing the meaning of their actions.
You'll have Professors going to war.
And this is not even an exaggeration for this has happened merely 75 years ago.


Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now .


People can be bigoted, even when they are smiling at your face, even when they are saying they love you.



I have been challenging myself, move beyond the group identity I sought as a teenager, to becoming an individual trying not to get lost in the crowd.


# 25-october-2024

How do you make the world better?
Tell the truth, because the world you bring in to being as a consequence of telling the truth will be a good world.


My Routine:
8 hours x 5 days working in job

6 hours x 7 days working on yourself.



Where am I falling short of my own ideals?
Where am I less then I should be?
Where am I bitter?
Where am I making world a worst place that it should be?
What will happen if I stop doing these things.


Stop saying things that makes you weak.
Stop saying lies that you know to be lies.
Stop doing things you know to be useless and counterproductive.
Aim high, adopt some responsibilities 
And then see what happens.


You should speak the truth, because your life turns out better if you speak the truth.


Be a monster(i.e fierce and formidable), but it shouldn't be accidental .
You should be able to say No, and let anyone who try to push you know that something bad may happen.
Be a positive monster, be someone who can say no and mean it, tell them there is nothing you can do to me that is going to make me do something I don't want to.
You won't have any strength of character if you can't put up a fight, if you can't say no to someone and fight for it 


I want that sense that I am engaged in something difficult, that's worth it.
Even though it causes extra suffering, apart from the general suffering present in life, but it's worth while to suffer for achieving that goal.

Mark Twain once said, “It’s not what we don’t know that gets us in trouble. It’s what we know for sure that just ain’t so.”


High serotonin, makes you stronger and more confident.



Happiness isn't something you need constantly; it's those fleeting moments that matter. What you really need is order—a framework that allows you to learn, grow, and move forward. But the key lies in avoiding extremes: too much order can become rigid and suffocating, while too much chaos leads to confusion and instability.

The real challenge is to find a balance between order and chaos, navigating the middle ground. In that space, you remain adaptable, flexible enough to embrace change without losing structure, and structured enough to avoid being overwhelmed. This balance is where growth, creativity, and genuine fulfillment are found.



Ever tried, ever failed, no matter, try again fail again, fail better and the world is yours.
Treat everyone kindly and light up the night.


What am I doing, I started thinking that everyone has to do there jobs and if they are not able to the task assigned to them, they shouldn't be on it, I was thinking that I should never help a person with there job, because it's there job and moreover when I saw someone lacking in the quality of there job , I started to think how hard that job is and he/she still couldn't do such simple "mundane" task and what waste of a human being they are.
But I don't know that person, I never walked in there shoes so why am I judging them , even if the person actually fucking up there job for whatever reason, if they are trying to do there best in a situation and improve, actually improve them slowly they can achieve big things,
Whatsoever I don't need to spend my energy of thoughts, mind, attention, intellect and rationality into finding out something negative in a person who's name I don't even know and who I'll probably never see in my life.
And as I write these observations of my behaviour, I have just realised it.
That means I wasn't doing this in a analysed, calculated responsive way.
Instead this was just a reflexive reaction of my subconscious coming from my negative conditioning from past and prejudices that I have around, plus my ego and everything intertwined together stirred up this reflexive reaction that gave life to these thoughts in my head that now when I am analysing, I know that this is not the response I want to give back to the world.
But I will admit I myself was lacking behind. 
Instead of giving a reflexive no-brainer reaction to a certain situation , moment or event presented in front of me at any given spacetime, I should spot,stop,swap these thoughts and always give myself or outside world a response that I want.
And stop living on an autopilot, or like a zombie.
And expand my consciousness and senses.


# 27-October-2024

I am running low on serotonin today, this chemical imbalance has got me twisted.
I feel like the nihilism is creeping in, I am facing this decision and need to make a choice.
Should I stay open to finding someone to start an intimate relationship or should o wait, take some time off for myself.
I think I will stay open but not consciously work towards finding someone for now, i.e I will not burn my mind over it and let the destiny take care of this for now.

When you are emotionally engaged in a subject your brain learns it 4X fast.


Would you rather stay at the known in your life and train yourself for the challenges that life may send your way.
Our would you go out in the unknown, seeking the challenges and face the head on .

Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness, became “geniuses” (as we put it), through qualities the lack of which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole. —FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE



It is not virtue's to be victimized by a Bully even so that bully is oneself.


People will sometimes choose an incompetent mate because they are intimidated by competence and so they'll
Settle for someone who they don't respect
Because they feel that they can master them and they won't be intimidated but that's not a good recipe for a happy life i can tell you that

Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately they fuel disappointment.
On the road of achieving your dreams you must apply discipline, but more importantly consistency . Because without commitment you'll never start but without consistency you never finish.


There's no shame in fear, what matters is how we face it.


You are strong because you are imperfect, you are wise because you have doubts.

"Success is not Final, Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts."
-**Winston Churchill** 


Certainty is the biggest disease of our time.
The need to know everything for sure , being binary, either it is a 0 or 1 nothing else in between. This idea is corrupting us from the inside, we need to let go of this obsession of having control over everything we touch.
