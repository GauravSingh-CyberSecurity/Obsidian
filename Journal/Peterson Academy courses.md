Why “TBD”?
Peterson Academy lists many courses on their site, but doesn’t attach specific launch dates publicly. Where a course’s month is certain (e.g. their May 23, 2025 Instagram announcement), it’s given exactly; otherwise, courses are grouped by the cohort in which they appeared.

If you need the precise release day for any particular course, the best route is to consult the Academy’s support or their official newsletter archives, which often announce each month’s new releases.
