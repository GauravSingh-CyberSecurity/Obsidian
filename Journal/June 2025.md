We are warriors we take the roads untravelled, not because it's easy.
But because we must.

When adversities come we do what we do best, we take the roads untravelled.


There is no peace without life, But there is no life without conflict.



What something is, is not the same as what it means.
But to understand that you will need to do more than just watch, you will need to see.
