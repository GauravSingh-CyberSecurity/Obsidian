That degenerate line that was getting quite viral online .

A stupid man says regarding to finding a woman to date-
Fisherman don't take advice from fish on how to catch it .

Now when I start dissecting it, I find it wrong at so many levels.

First of all are you trying to find a partner for life or are you trying to catch something that you can devour to satisfy your hunger?

==From intro to Nietzsche series by Peterson academy (continued in may notes from April notes)==


INTEGRATE THE MULTIPLICITOUS SPIRITS WITHIN YOU INTO A SINGLE TOTALITY


RESENTMENT WILL BREED DARK FANTASIES


THE FANTASIES WILL BE DARK IN PROPORTION TO YOUR WEAKNESS


YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL PREY TO THE SLAVE-LIKE MARTYRDOM


YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO FALL PREY TO THE RESENTFUL VIOLENCE


INTEGRATION OF THE FANTASY MOVES YOU TOWARDS THE IDEAL


THE HIGHEST 'WILL TO POWER' IS THE CONTINUAL INCLUSION OF THAT WHICH HAD BEEN EXCLUDED


JUNG CALLED THE HIGHER UNITY THE "SELF"


WILL TO POWER AIMS AT UNITY WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THAT UNITY?


WILL TO POWER AIMS AT UNITY WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THAT UNITY? IT'S NOT SIMPLE SELF-PRESERVATION



There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are 'immediate certainties'; for example, 'I think,' or as the superstition of Schopenhauer put it, 'I will'; as though knowledge here got hold of its object purely and nakedly as 'the thing in itself, without any falsification on the part of either the subject or the object.



WHAT DO YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED?
WHAT ARE YOU PRESUMING WITH YOUR QUESTION?



THE WILL TO THE END IS IMPLICIT IN THE PERCEPTION



WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD YOU SEE TOOLS & OBSTACLES


Let the people suppose that knowledge means knowing things entirely; the philosopher must say to himself: When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions that would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove; for example, that it is I who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks,
from Friedrich Nietzsche



that there must necessarily be something that thinks,

that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and, finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking-that I know what thinking is.
from Friedrich Nietzsche



EVERYTHING IS QUESTIONABLE



IF EVERYTHING IS QUESTIONABLE THAT'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY & DOUBT


WE PACK THAT COMPLEXITY INTO AN INVISIBLE CERTAINTY


WILLIAM JAMES THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS TRUE IF IT WORKS WELL ENOUGH FOR NOW


THE PRAGMATISTS WOULD SAY IT'S ALWAYS ONLY 'TRUE ENOUGH'.


WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE COLLECTIVE IS WRONG?



With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of emphasizing a small terse fact, which these superstitious minds hate to concede-namely, that a thought comes when 'it' wishes, and not when I wish.
so that it is a falsification of the facts of the case to say that the subject 'l' is the condition of the predicate 'think.'
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



ELEMENTS OF REALITY
REVEAL THEMSELVES TO YOU


REPLACING THE NOTION OF A TRANSCENDENT
UNITY WITH THE NOTION OF 'I'



THE MORE YOU ADMIT THAT YOU'RE WRONG AND THE MORE YOU WANT AN ANSWER THE MORE ANSWERS YOU'RE GOING TO GET


It thinks; but that this 'it' is precisely the famous old 'ego' is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an 'immediate certainty.'
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



SO MANY BROKEN PEOPLE NEVER EVEN GOT TO THE POINT OF TWO YEAR OLD INTEGRATION


THE INSISTANCE OF MULTIPLE IDENTITIES IS SOMETHING LIKE THE RE-EMERGENCE OF FANTASY PLAY


WHO IS THINKING UP THE THOUGHTS?

THOSE THINGS THAT THINK WITHIN YOU
THEY ARE NOT YOU


"ONE SHOULD ASK ONESELF FOR ONCE: WHY HAS THIS IDEA TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME?"
-Carl Jung



It thinks; but that this 'it' is precisely the famous old 'ego' is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an 'immediate certainty.'
from Friedrich Nietzsche's


That individual philosophical concepts are not anything capricious or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each other;
that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought.
they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as all the members of the fauna of a continent-
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



SANITY IS LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC


IF YOU WERE OPTIMALLY EMBEDDED IN A COHERENT SYSTEM OF HIERARCHY YOU WOULD BE SANE


SANITY IS NOT 'IN YOU' IT'S MORE LIKE YOUR ABILITY TO DANCE TO THE MUSIC


IF YOU'RE A TYRANT RULER OF HELL THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'VE SUCCEEDED


HUMAN PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS
ROTATE AROUND A CENTRALIZED ETHOS


...they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as all the members of the fauna of a continent-is betrayed in the end also by the fact that the most diverse philosophers keep filling in a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies.
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



THINK OF PHILOSOPHY AS SOMETHING YOU ACT OUT


YOUR DESTINY IS THE PARTICULARIZATION OF AN ARCHETYPE


YOU CAN EITHER PURSUE YOUR ARCHETYPE VOLUNTARILY
OR YOU CAN LET ARCHETYPES MANIFEST IN YOU UNCONSCIOUSLY


NIETZSCHE WOULD ASK:
ARE YOU NIHILISTIC OR JUST USELESS?


THERE IS A UNIVERSE OF POSSIBLE PHILOSOPHIES


SOCIETY IS THE EMERGENCE OF A COLLECTIVE META-GAME OF FRIENDS



**==IF YOU CONFRONTED THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE IN THE SPIRIT OF PLAY, YOU'D BE A MASTER==**



Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit; however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in a definite order, one after the other-to wit, the innate systematic structure and relationship of their concepts.
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



"EVERY ORGANISM MUST BE A MICROCOSM OF ITS ENVIRONMENT"
-Richard Dawkins


TO WHAT DEGREE CAN YOU DERIVE THE NOTION OF A MORAL ORDER PURELY ON THE ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVE FACTS?


THE MATERIAL WORLD IS STRIVING FORWARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN UNDERLYING LOGOS


SCIENCE IS NECESSARILY EMBEDDED IN A NARRATIVE STRUCTURE



WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE AROUND?
THE PERSON WHO IS ALL WILL TO POWER OR ALL WILL TO PLAY?



All psychology so far has got stuck in moral prejudices and fears; it has not dared to descend into the depths. To understand it as morphology and the doctrine of the development of the will to power, as I do-nobody has yet come close to doing this even in thought...
from Friedrich Nietzsche's


"The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most spiritual world, which would seem to be the coldest and most devoid of presuppositions, and has obviously operated in an injurious, inhibiting, blinding, and distorting manner.
A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious resistance in the heart of the investigator...
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



...it has 'the heart' against it: even a doctrine of the reciprocal dependence of the "good" and the 'wicked' drives, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still hale and hearty conscience-still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from wicked ones.
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



ALMOST EVERYTHING WE BENEFIT FROM IS PRODUCED BY A MINORITY OF HYPER-PRODUCERS


TRUTH OFTEN REQUIRES THAT YOU RECOGNIZE SOMETHING YOU'D RATHER NOT RECOGNIZE


A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious resistance in the heart of the investigator, it has 'the heart' against it: even a doctrine of the reciprocal dependence of the 'good' and the 'wicked' drives, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still hale and hearty conscience-still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from wicked ones.
from Friedrich Nietzsche's


If, however, a person should regard even the affects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life, as factors which, fundamentally and essentially, must be present in the general economy of life (and must, therefore, be further enhanced if life is to be further enhanced)-he will suffer from such a view of things as from seasickness.
from Friedrich Nietzsche's


LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A CAPACITY FOR HATRED SHOULD YOU DISPENSE WITH THAT?


How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, that cannot be waged openly by means of force!
from Friedrich Nietzsche's


How personal does a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible enemies!
from Friedrich Nietzsche's


These outcasts of society, these long-pursued, wickedly persecuted ones-also the compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos-always become in the end, even under the most spiritual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware of it, sophisticated vengeance-seekers and poison-brewers...
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



(let someone lay bare the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that his philosophical sense of humor has left him.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's



Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty; and the higher man must listen closely to every coarse or subtle cynicism, and congratulate himself when a clown without shame or a scientific satyr speaks out precisely in front of him.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's



WHAT'S BEYOND CYNICISM?

COURAGEOUS TRUST TRANSCENDS CYNICISM

CYNICISM IS THE TRANSITION POINT BETWEEN NAIVETY AND WISDOM

GOING PAST CYNICISM ALLIES TRUST WITH COURAGE


MOST SEED FALLS ON BARREN GROUND
MOST THINGS DIE POINTLESSLY



DO NOT EDIT WHEN YOU'RE PRODUCING,
DON'T THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
YOU NEED A LOT OF APPROXIMATION OF THE TARGET BEFORE YOU HIT IT


THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY AND HOW YOU CAN OPTIMIZE THAT


They belong, briefly and sadly, among the levelers-these falsely so-called 'free spirits'-being eloquent and prolifically scribbling slaves of the democratic taste and its 'modern ideas'; they are all human beings without solitude, without their own solitude, clumsy good fellows whom one should not deny either courage or respectable decency-
from Friedrich Nietzsche's



...only they are unfree and ridiculously superficial, above all in their basic inclination to find in the forms of the old society as it has existed so far just about the cause of all human misery and failure-which is a way of standing truth happily upon her head!

from Friedrich Nietzsche's



"A MAN OF GENIUS IS UNBEARABLE, UNLESS HE POSSESS AT LEAST TWO THINGS BESIDES: GRATITUDE & PURITY"
-Friedrich Nietzsche



EVERYBODY WALKS ON SOIL SOAKED IN BLOOD


NIETZSCHE OFTEN TALKS ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF 'RESSENTIMENT'


What they would like to strive for with all their powers

is the universal green-pasture happiness of the herd, with security, lack of danger, comfort, and an easier life for everyone:
from Friedrich Nietzsche's




THERE'S A RELIGIOUS IDEA THAT THE WORLD IS A BATTLE BETWEEN PRINCIPALITIES

AN IDEA 'SPIRIT' CAN POSSESS A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE BY EACH ONE REPRESENTING A PART

IDEAS ARE SUB-PERSONALITIES

YOU THINK YOUR IDEAS ARE YOUR OWN BUT THEY AREN'T

IT'S REASONABLE TO TRY AND INFER WHAT
THE AIM OF A SYSTEM OF IDEAS IS


WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE CENTER POINT OF NIETZSCHE'S 'WILL TO POWER' AND UNDERSTAND IT


IF YOU GRAPPLE WITH ANY GREAT SPIRIT YOU WILL INCORPORATE SOME OF THEIR ETHOS


GREATNESS IS A POINTER TOWARDS WHAT IS INTRINSICALLY DIVINE


"WE DO NOT LEARN; AND WHAT WE CALL LEARNING IS ONLY A PROCESS OF RECOLLECTION"
-Plato



THE OEDIPAL MOTHER WANTS THE BABY NEVER TO GO AWAY



Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species...
(from Fyodor Dostoevsky's
"NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND")


...even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point!
(from Fyodor Dostoevsky's)
"NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND"



EVERY IDEAL IS A JUDGE
And
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU & THE IDEAL FEELS LIKE A JUDGMENT

YOU EXPERIENCE HOPE IN RELATIONSHIP TO AN IDEAL
(I.e if you pursuing to achieve an ideal you feel hope)


...with security, lack of danger, comfort, and an easier life for everyone; the two songs and doctrines which they repeat most often are 'equality of rights' and 'sympathy for all that suffers' -and suffering itself they take for something that must be abolished.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's




PSYCHOTHERAPY ENCOURAGES YOU TO VOLUNTARILY CONFRONT WHAT YOU ARE AVOIDING



**==LEARNING IS TAKING A FRACTION OF THE INFINITE AND REDUCING IT UNTIL WE CAN FACE IT==**

---

THE ANTI-BEING ETHOS MANIFESTS IN ANTI-BEING ACTIONS

IS THE COMPASSIONATE THING TO DO JUST TO STOP THE BEING?

EXCESSIVE COMPASSION IS MORE THAN MURDEROUS

EXCESSIVE COMPASSION IS MORE THAN MURDEROUS IT'S ANTI-BEING

Sadly, COMPASSION IS NOW THE ONLY UNQUESTIONABLE MORAL VIRTUE

---

ENCOURAGEMENT IS FAITH IN WHAT YOU COULD BE RATHER THAN WHAT YOU ARE


IT'S A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO ARE ON THE SIDE OF YOU STRIVING UP


We opposite men, having opened our eyes and conscience to the question where and how the plant 'man' has so far grown most vigorously to a height-we think that this has happened every time under the opposite conditions, that to this end the dangerousness of his situation must first grow to the point of enormity...

from Friedrich Nietzsche's



...his power of invention and simulation (his 'spirit') had to develop under prolonged pressure and constraint into refinement and audacity, his life-will had to be enhanced into an unconditional power-will.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's



UNLESS YOU PUSH YOURSELF TO THE EDGE THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION

THE ATTRACTION OF SECURITY DOES BECKON

IF EVERYTHING IS DONE FOR YOU WHAT'S THERE FOR YOU TO DO?



WHAT'S YOUR VISION OF MAN?


**The Origins and History of Consciousness**
Book by the psychologist and philosopher Erich Neumann where he attempts to "outline the archetypal stages in the development of consciousness"



CULTURES THAT FOSTERED NOBILITY EXPOSED THEIR CHILDREN TO DANGER


"We think that hardness, forcefulness, slavery, danger in the alley and the heart, life in hiding, stoicism, the art of experiment and devilry of every kind, that everything evil, terrible, tyrannical in man, everything in him that is kin to beasts of prey and serpents, serves the enhancement of the species 'man' as much as its opposite does.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's





OPTIMIZED SUFFERING CATALYZES THE INTEGRATION OF 'EVIL' DRIVES


FIRE & PRESSURE IS WHAT COMPELS THE CONFRONTATIONAL CHARACTERISTIC


A MOTHER'S JOB ISN'T TO MAKE THEIR KID HAPPY IT'S TO MAKE THEIR KID INTO AN ADULT


Modern men, obtuse to all Christian nomenclature, no longer feel the gruesome superlative that struck a classical taste in the paradoxical formula 'god on the cross.'

from Friedrich Nietzsche's





THE GOAL IS TO SERVE WHAT HAS POTENTIAL AND NOT JUST WHAT YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH


ATHEISTS OFTEN RELATE THE RELIGIOUS ENTERPRISE WITH A TOTALITARIAN SPIRIT


Never yet and nowhere has there been an equal boldness in inversion, anything as horrible, questioning, and questionable as this formula:

it promised a revaluation of all the values of antiquity.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's




YOU ADMIRE PEOPLE WHOSE PRODUCTIVE GENEROSITY IS OVERFLOWING



SERVICE TO THE DISPOSSESSED SHOULDN'T BE OUT OF PITY IT SHOULD BE TO 'FOSTER THE GROWTH OF'



THE IDEA THAT THE HIGHEST SHOULD
SERVE THE LOWEST IS A CALL TO A MODE OF LIFE




IF YOU'RE GENEROUS & PRODUCTIVE YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD A COMMUNITY



It is the Orient, deep Orient, it is the Oriental slave who revenged himself in this way on Rome and its noble and frivolous tolerance, on the Roman 'catholicity' of faith. It has always been not faith but the freedom from faith, that half-stoical and smiling unconcern with the seriousness of faith, that enraged slaves in their masters-against their masters.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's





JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE VICTIMIZED DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE MORAL

SOLZHENITSYN REFUSED TO BE A VICTIM





IF YOU ARE ALIGNED WITH THE ANIMATING SPIRIT OF MANKIND YOU ARE UNSTOPPABLE


The socratic way:
SOCRATES ALWAYS DID WHAT HIS VOICE OF CONSCIENCE
TOLD HIM TO DO



Enlightenment' enrages: for the slave wants the unconditional; he understands only what is tyrannical, in morals, too; he loves as he hates, without nuance, to the depths, to the point of pain, of sickness-his abundant concealed suffering is enraged against the noble taste that seems to deny suffering.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's





You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.

from The Bible




Nor was skepticism concerning suffering, at bottom merely a pose of aristocratic morality, the least cause of the origin of the last great slave rebellion which began with the French Revolution.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's





PHILOSOPHY & KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IS NARRATIVE IN STRUCTURE


IF YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP IT WILL BE CONTAMINATED BY POWER


TO NOTE THAT THE MOST POTENT FORCE OF CORRUPTION IS THE ATTRACTION OF POWER IS NOT THE SAME CLAIM AS: THAT'S THE CENTRAL ETHOS OF THE RELATIONSHIP


NIETZSCHE KNEW RESENTMENT WAS THE MOST PATHOLOGICAL OF POLITICAL FORCES



COMMUNISM IS THE ALLIANCE OF POWER & RESENTMENT



What is amazing about the religiosity of the ancient Greeks is the enormous abundance of gratitude it exudes: it is a very noble type of man that confronts nature and life in this way.

Later, when the rabble gained the upper hand in Greece, fear became rampant in religion, too-and the ground was prepared for Christianity.

from Friedrich Nietzsche's






**==IS YOUR STANCE OPPRESSED VICTIM OR COURAGEOUS GRATITUDE?==**

"NO MATTER WHAT THE REASONS ARE THE BITTERNESS IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE"




THE IDEA THAT RELIGION IS A SHIELD AGAINST DEATH ANXIETY IS A PREPOSTEROUS IDEA



To be sure, whoever is himself merely a meager, tame domestic animal and knows only the needs of domestic animals (like our educated people of today, including the Christians of 'educated' Christianity) has no cause for amazement or sorrow among these ruins-the taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone for 'great' and 'small'-

from Friedrich Nietzsche's



JUNG OBSERVED A NARRATIVE OF HEROIC TRANSCENDENCE THAT WAS UNIVERSALLY APPREHENSIBLE




**==WHEN ENCOUNTERING GREAT THINKERS**==
==**YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY YOU MIGHT BE REJECTING WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY==**

WHAT STORY DO YOU ACT OUT?
