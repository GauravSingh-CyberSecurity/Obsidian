Yes, with your qualifications (OSCP, OSWA, OSWE certifications, a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity, and 7 years of experience), you can absolutely open a company in your name in the U.S. and engage in bug bounty hunting on platforms like HackerOne as the sole employee. Since you plan to set up the business in New York, here’s a detailed roadmap to help you achieve your goal:

Step 1: Visa Options for Self-Employment in the U.S.

To live and work in the U.S. as a self-employed individual, you will need a visa that supports entrepreneurial activities. The key visa options for you are:

1.1 E-2 Treaty Investor Visa

What is it?: The E-2 visa is available to citizens of countries (India is included) that have a treaty with the U.S., allowing them to invest in and run a U.S.-based business.

Eligibility:

You must invest a substantial amount of money (typically around $100,000 or more) into your business.

Your business must be actively managed and not just a passive investment.

You must show that your business will generate enough income to support you (and potentially employees) in the U.S.

Bug bounty hunting can qualify as an eligible business activity, as long as you prove it is sustainable and profitable.


Steps to Apply:

1. Create a detailed business plan showing how your bug bounty hunting company will generate revenue.


2. Show proof of investment (the required capital) in the business.


3. Apply for the E-2 Visa by submitting all necessary documents to the U.S. consulate in India.




1.2 O-1 Visa (Extraordinary Ability)

What is it?: The O-1 visa is for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary abilities in their field (cybersecurity, in your case).

Eligibility:

You’ll need to show evidence of significant achievements, such as:

Recognition in the form of bug bounty awards, publications, influence in the cybersecurity community, etc.

7 years of experience, along with your OSCP, OSWA, and OSWE certifications, can support your application.


The O-1 visa allows you to work in your area of expertise (cybersecurity) in the U.S.


Steps to Apply:

1. Collect evidence of your extraordinary ability (e.g., awards, publications, notable contributions to the community).


2. Apply for the O-1 Visa, which would allow you to work in the U.S. based on your extraordinary abilities.

Step 2: Setting Up Your Business in New York

Once you have secured your visa (E-2 or O-1), you can set up your business in New York. Here’s how to do that:

2.1 Choose a Business Structure

Since you will be the only employee, the most common and recommended structure is LLC (Limited Liability Company), but Sole Proprietorship is also an option if you don’t need the liability protection of an LLC.

LLC (Limited Liability Company):

Offers liability protection for personal assets.

Flexibility in taxation (you can opt for pass-through taxation).

Professional image and more credibility with clients and platforms like HackerOne.


Sole Proprietorship:

Simpler setup with less paperwork.

No legal protection for your personal assets.

Easier tax filing, but with potential personal risk.



Recommended: Start with an LLC for better protection and professionalism.

2.2 Register Your LLC in New York

Choose a name for your business. Make sure it's unique and not already registered with the state.

Register the LLC with the New York Department of State (you can do this online).

Obtain an EIN (Employer Identification Number) from the IRS (this is needed for tax filing and opening a business bank account).


2.3 Register for Taxes in New York

You must register with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.

Depending on your income and business structure, you may need to collect sales tax (if applicable) and pay state taxes.

Set up your tax payments with the IRS (for federal taxes) and the state of New York.



---

Step 3: Open a Business Bank Account

Separate your personal and business finances by opening a business bank account.

Use this account to manage payments from bug bounty platforms like HackerOne, pay for business expenses, and maintain records of your earnings.

You'll need your EIN, LLC registration documents, and identification to open a bank account.



---

Step 4: Begin Bug Bounty Hunting

With your LLC set up, you can now start working as a bug bounty hunter under your own business:

4.1 Join Bug Bounty Platforms

HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Synack, and Cobalt are popular platforms for bug bounty programs.

Register your business (using your LLC details) on these platforms and start participating in bug bounty programs.

As a sole employee of your business, you’ll be doing all the work, but ensure that your payments and invoices are processed under your business name.


4.2 Build Reputation and Portfolio

Track your progress on platforms like HackerOne. Building a reputation and successfully completing bug bounty programs will increase your credibility and income potential.

Start creating a portfolio of your work. If you have a significant number of vulnerabilities reported, you can use this as evidence of your expertise.


4.3 Diversify Revenue Streams

Once established, you can expand your business by:

Offering consulting services in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and cybersecurity training.

Writing research papers, blogging, or hosting webinars.

Developing cybersecurity tools and products.

Step 5: Legal and Tax Compliance

As a self-employed individual running your business, you will need to ensure that you comply with U.S. tax laws and legal requirements:

5.1 File Taxes as a Self-Employed Individual

Since you’ll be the sole owner and employee, you’ll need to file taxes as a self-employed individual.

You will be subject to self-employment tax (15.3% for Social Security and Medicare), along with federal income tax and state taxes.

Keep detailed records of all your earnings, expenses, and receipts.


5.2 Maintain Business Records

Ensure that you have proper accounting records for your business transactions. Use tools like QuickBooks, Xero, or FreshBooks to manage your finances.

It’s advisable to work with an accountant familiar with U.S. tax laws, especially since you’ll be working in a niche area like bug bounty hunting.



---

Step 6: Scaling Your Business (Optional)

Once your bug bounty hunting business becomes successful and stable, consider scaling it:

6.1 Hiring Contractors or Employees

As you grow, you may need to hire contractors or additional employees to help with various tasks or expand your offerings (e.g., penetration testing services, security consulting).

You can hire people as independent contractors or as employees under your LLC.


6.2 Expand Service Offerings

Start diversifying into other areas of cybersecurity, such as:

Penetration testing.

Security audits.

Incident response.

Cybersecurity training and consulting.



6.3 Market Your Services

Use social media, cybersecurity conferences, and online communities to market your business.

Write case studies, publish security blogs, or offer free resources to gain visibility and attract more clients.

Conclusion

With your impressive qualifications and experience, setting up a bug bounty hunting business in New York is very feasible. You can create a limited liability company (LLC), apply for an appropriate visa (like E-2 or O-1), and start working on platforms like HackerOne as the sole employee of your business. By following these steps, you can create a sustainable self-employed career in cybersecurity and bug bounty hunting in the U.S.
