# Study on psychopathic behaviours:

Psychopathy is **extension of immaturity into adulthood** 

Maturity is the ability to forgo, your immediate gratification . 


According to psychopathy literature:

Usually people with acute antisocial behaviour suffer from psychopathy. And
Psychopaths are notorious for being **unable to learn from there experience** ,
If ,eg: They do something impulsive that causes them trouble in future, **the fact of that future trouble has no bearing on their continued behaviour.**
They are so non communitarian that they are even willing to betray their own future self, and their is no difference in them being capable of betraying themselves and betraying someone else, it's exactly the same mechanism, 
**very much like a toddler in an adults body.**


Psychopaths lack an internalized sense of morality, empathy, or responsibility. Because they don't feel guilt or emotional connection in the way most people do, they might struggle with making ethical choices.


**Seeking External Moral Structures (Spirits as a Metaphor)**

Since psychopaths lack an inner moral compass,  they may try to "submit" to something external—religion, ideology, or even dangerous influences—to fill the void.

In a symbolic sense, "spirits possessing them" could mean that **they seek external forces to dictate their behavior, as they struggle to regulate themselves internally.**


**Carl Jung’s** ideas on possession, where a person who lacks a solid identity or morality might be "taken over" by destructive impulses, ideologies, or even extreme religious fervor.

In the case of psychopaths, if they don't consciously choose a structured path, they may become "possessed" by power, nihilism, or destructive behaviors

Conclusion:

psychopaths, due to their lack of inner guidance, are more susceptible to being "possessed"—whether by religious fervor, extremist ideologies, or their own unchecked desires. Praying could be their way of seeking order, structure, or redemption in a world where they otherwise feel disconnected from moral and emotional norms.



**To tackle the Psychopaths** , be aware of there repeated action that cause you  troubles, set clear boundaries with them, use skepticism for any encounter with them, trust your instincts and avoid being overly polite with them it may compromise your position to question their wrong behaviour , do not let them exploit your goodwill.

If you push yourself beyond your zone of comfort even if that zone is functioning for you, you'll live your life in a manner that's a blessing to you.

It's a volunteering quest , trying to be better than you are today.

By doing this you'll be renowned among people justly.

If you follow the pathway of adventure, you'll be father of Nations.

Once You put yourself on the edge of adventure voluntarily, you'll be following an instinct that has already evolved to make your life a blessing for yourself, to make you successful among other people , to maximize your probability of long term success that too in a way that brings abundance to your community.

But remember you can get lost in false adventures that can happen, that is what an addiction is like pornography, smoking, eating, binge watching, pursuing after women for sexual agendas,etc. it's failure to hit the proper target , the actual true adventure of life .

Push yourself beyond your limits in pursuit of that adventure.
That's the characterization of the divine.


The voice that calls to the wise to prepare in times of trouble is the voice of the divine , and its the same voice calling the unwilling to adventure.



If for 10 years, if you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do.
What would you be like.
And how high would you aim, if you knew you couldn't fail.

Because you are not everything you could be, and you know it.
What would happen if you stopped wasting the opportunities in front of you.
You'll be 10-20 times more efficient

The Adventures of life you are seeking is in the responsibilities you are avoiding.

Adventure and responsibility are the same thing, the higher the responsibility you adopt, the greater the adventure you find in life.
For when the stakes are high, and seeing the task through and being responsible in that situation where no one dares to step in due to fear of failure is the true form of adventure.

For example: james bond 007 movies, where he is an international spy try to stop the bad actors from total annihilation of civilizations, he bears the sole responsibility to stop those villian from seeking doom of the world.

Or the spiderman movie, where the quote goes "with great power comes great responsibility " and as a result of the great responsibility the spiderman experiences great adventures, like stopping a train wreck, stopping the goblin or saving mary jane(MJ), saving the whole world in infinity wars and end game.



Sacrifice is the centre of a community.
In essence that every person of the community must sacrifice what they want right now, for the better future of the whole community.


Why am I conducting all of my scientific , psychological and philosophical investigations?
I am trying to better understand the human psyche.
Well why?
Because I want to be an aid for human enterprise.
I wanna make things better, I want to pursue truth in a manner that makes things better.
That's my story.
