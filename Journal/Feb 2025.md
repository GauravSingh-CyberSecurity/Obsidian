# Study on psychopathic behaviours:

Psychopathy is **extension of immaturity into adulthood** 

Maturity is the ability to forgo, your immediate gratification . 


According to psychopathy literature:

Usually people with acute antisocial behaviour suffer from psychopathy. And
Psychopaths are notorious for being **unable to learn from there experience** ,
If ,eg: They do something impulsive that causes them trouble in future, **the fact of that future trouble has no bearing on their continued behaviour.**
They are so non communitarian that they are even willing to betray their own future self, and their is no difference in them being capable of betraying themselves and betraying someone else, it's exactly the same mechanism, 
**very much like a toddler in an adults body.**


Psychopaths lack an internalized sense of morality, empathy, or responsibility. Because they don't feel guilt or emotional connection in the way most people do, they might struggle with making ethical choices.


**Seeking External Moral Structures (Spirits as a Metaphor)**

Since psychopaths lack an inner moral compass,  they may try to "submit" to something external—religion, ideology, or even dangerous influences—to fill the void.

In a symbolic sense, "spirits possessing them" could mean that **they seek external forces to dictate their behavior, as they struggle to regulate themselves internally.**


**Carl Jung’s** ideas on possession, where a person who lacks a solid identity or morality might be "taken over" by destructive impulses, ideologies, or even extreme religious fervor.

In the case of psychopaths, if they don't consciously choose a structured path, they may become "possessed" by power, nihilism, or destructive behaviors

Conclusion:

psychopaths, due to their lack of inner guidance, are more susceptible to being "possessed"—whether by religious fervor, extremist ideologies, or their own unchecked desires. Praying could be their way of seeking order, structure, or redemption in a world where they otherwise feel disconnected from moral and emotional norms.



**To tackle the Psychopaths** , be aware of there repeated action that cause you  troubles, set clear boundaries with them, use skepticism for any encounter with them, trust your instincts and avoid being overly polite with them it may compromise your position to question their wrong behaviour , do not let them exploit your goodwill.

If you push yourself beyond your zone of comfort even if that zone is functioning for you, you'll live your life in a manner that's a blessing to you.

It's a volunteering quest , trying to be better than you are today.

By doing this you'll be renowned among people justly.

If you follow the pathway of adventure, you'll be father of Nations.

Once You put yourself on the edge of adventure voluntarily, you'll be following an instinct that has already evolved to make your life a blessing for yourself, to make you successful among other people , to maximize your probability of long term success that too in a way that brings abundance to your community.

But remember you can get lost in false adventures that can happen, that is what an addiction is like pornography, smoking, eating, binge watching, pursuing after women for sexual agendas,etc. it's failure to hit the proper target , the actual true adventure of life .

Push yourself beyond your limits in pursuit of that adventure.
That's the characterization of the divine.


The voice that calls to the wise to prepare in times of trouble is the voice of the divine , and its the same voice calling the unwilling to adventure.



If for 10 years, if you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do.
What would you be like.
And how high would you aim, if you knew you couldn't fail.

Because you are not everything you could be, and you know it.
What would happen if you stopped wasting the opportunities in front of you.
You'll be 10-20 times more efficient

The Adventures of life you are seeking is in the responsibilities you are avoiding.

Adventure and responsibility are the same thing, the higher the responsibility you adopt, the greater the adventure you find in life.
For when the stakes are high, and seeing the task through and being responsible in that situation where no one dares to step in due to fear of failure is the true form of adventure.

For example: james bond 007 movies, where he is an international spy try to stop the bad actors from total annihilation of civilizations, he bears the sole responsibility to stop those villian from seeking doom of the world.

Or the spiderman movie, where the quote goes "with great power comes great responsibility " and as a result of the great responsibility the spiderman experiences great adventures, like stopping a train wreck, stopping the goblin or saving mary jane(MJ), saving the whole world in infinity wars and end game.



Sacrifice is the centre of a community.
In essence that every person of the community must sacrifice what they want right now, for the better future of the whole community.


Why am I conducting all of my scientific , psychological and philosophical investigations?
I am trying to better understand the human psyche.
Well why?
Because I want to be an aid for human enterprise.
I wanna make things better, I want to pursue truth in a manner that makes things better.
That's my story.

As a medium to long term gain there's nothing better than pursuit of the truth.

Truth is an adventure, because If you vow to follow the path of truth.
You have to let go of the predictability of outcome.

You have to let go of your predetermined goal, in order to seek truth, to have the adventure of life.

Why would you exchange that for a biennial predictability, well to build your career to have security in future.
You are foregoing 

But doing so means giving up the exciting and adventurous element of life that is outcome of following the path of truth, wherever it may lead.

If you aim up and live in the spirit of the truth,
You'll have the redemptive adventure of your life.
And that'll be of such significant that it will justify the suffering that's intrinsic to life.


Calling beckons and conscience provides disciplinary limitations.


It takes many many many generations to evolve a species, and it doesn't take many to devolve a species.

All the hard work that our ancestors put in evolving our species, now when you look around this generation just pissing on all of it, they are oblivious to their own ignorance trapped in false trends of the world.


The relationship between responsibility and adventure is 
If the aim is true the voyage is worthwhile.

**Behind every great human destiny echoes as refrain an even greater “in vain!”**

The quote suggests that even the grandest human accomplishments are shadowed by a sense of meaninglessness. No matter how significant a person’s destiny, it is accompanied by an unavoidable whisper of futility—as if striving for greatness is ultimately futile in the face of mortality, impermanence, or the universe’s indifference.

The quote captures the bittersweet duality of human existence: our drive to achieve greatness is both heroic and tinged with futility. It invites reflection on whether our pursuits are meaningful in themselves or rendered hollow by time, death, or cosmic indifference. The "echo" of "in vain" serves as a sobering counterpoint to human pride, urging humility or acceptance of life’s transient nature.

Now ,This is the thing

People who get so much chained up in their ideology that they are so rigidly tied in their ideologies that they cannot even move ,
And anything that is remotely different not even opposite just different then their own beliefs, becomes enemy for them, becomes evil that must be fought and defeated.

These people when rise up in power and start to shove their ideology down everyone's throat, must be stop even by force If needed.
But when you see the same kind of person in the streets or in regular life the best course of action is to avoid them, for they are not threat big enough for humanity and for you to fuck up your day.

I used to think the worst thing in life is ending up all alone, it's not.
The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.


They kill your dreams in name of opportunities, privileges a path that they can see for you, even if they are blind to see the soul in you..
