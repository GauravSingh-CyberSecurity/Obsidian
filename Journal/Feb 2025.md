Psychopathy is extension of immaturity into adulthood 

Maturity is the ability to forgo, your immediate gratification . 


According to psychopathological literature:

Usually people with acute antisocial behaviour suffer from psychopathy. And
Psychopaths are notorious for being unable to learn from there experience ,
If ,eg: They do something impulsive that causes them trouble in future, the fact of that future trouble has no bearing on their continued behaviour.
They are so non communitarian that they are even willing to betray their own future self, and their is no difference in them being capable of betraying themselves and betraying someone else, it's exactly the same mechanism, 
very much like a toddler in a man's body.


Psychopaths lack an internalized sense of morality, empathy, or responsibility. Because they don't feel guilt or emotional connection in the way most people do, they might struggle with making ethical choices.


**Seeking External Moral Structures (Spirits as a Metaphor)**

Since psychopaths lack an inner moral compass,  they may try to "submit" to something external—religion, ideology, or even dangerous influences—to fill the void.

In a symbolic sense, "spirits possessing them" could mean that **they seek external forces to dictate their behavior, as they struggle to regulate themselves internally.**


**Carl Jung’s** ideas on possession, where a person who lacks a solid identity or morality might be "taken over" by destructive impulses, ideologies, or even extreme religious fervor.

In the case of psychopaths, if they don't consciously choose a structured path, they may become "possessed" by power, nihilism, or destructive behaviors
