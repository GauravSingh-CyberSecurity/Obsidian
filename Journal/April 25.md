Adversity always lies in the path of advancement, most would run from it but I would Walk through it,
That is why destiny chose me to lead.


What holds more truth, history or prophecy?


Man with no purpose devices only mischief.







Lying, do you know what that makes a man..
A criminal ?
A sociopath ?

A survivor.
Hunan beings rely on lies to survive,
We lie to our enemies.
We lie to our friends.
We lie to ourselves.

Lying is among the most sophisticated task our brain can perform.

Because for most of us, we don't like to lie, 
body rejects it. How does it do tha?

Pupils dilate, changes in breathing, expression on eyebrows.

All of them are signs that we work to perceive truth saying.









He is a man of focus, commitment and shear fucking will.




Humans are odd,
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings,
I think they missed that .
They are doomed, but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts .
It's a privilege to be among them.




I won't overlook their transgressions anymore.



People act like these thinking machines are something different than us. They are us
