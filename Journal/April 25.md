Adversity always lies in the path of advancement, most would run from it but I would Walk through it,
That is why destiny chose me to lead.


What holds more truth, history or prophecy?


Man with no purpose devices only mischief.







Lying, do you know what that makes a man..
A criminal ?
A sociopath ?

A survivor.
Hunan beings rely on lies to survive,
We lie to our enemies.
We lie to our friends.
We lie to ourselves.

Lying is among the most sophisticated task our brain can perform.

Because for most of us, we don't like to lie, 
body rejects it. How does it do tha?

Pupils dilate, changes in breathing, expression on eyebrows.

All of them are signs that we work to perceive truth saying.









He is a man of focus, commitment and shear fucking will.




Humans are odd,
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings,
I think they missed that .
They are doomed, but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts .
It's a privilege to be among them.




I won't overlook their transgressions anymore.



People act like these thinking machines are something different than us. They are us


# **6 April** 

A master has failed more than an amature ever tried.





Fyodor Dostoevsky, through his works—especially Notes from Underground, The Brothers Karamazov, and Crime and Punishment—presents a profound and often unsettling view of human nature.

He challenges the Enlightenment idea that human beings primarily desire a rational, comfortable, and fulfilled life. Instead, Dostoevsky argues that man is not simply a creature of reason, but of irrationality, contradiction, and spiritual struggle.

On Fulfillment and Comfort:

In Notes from Underground, the narrator mockingly critiques the idea that if all human needs were met—if people lived in a “crystal palace” of logic and comfort—they would be satisfied. Dostoevsky writes:

> "Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering... Man likes to make roads, but he also likes to break them down."



In other words, even when offered a fulfilled life—peace, comfort, pleasure—humans often rebel. Why? Because we crave freedom, even if it leads to chaos or destruction. We don’t want to be predictable machines; we want to feel we choose our path, even if it’s irrational.

What Are Humans Actually Pursuing?

Dostoevsky suggests that what humans truly pursue is meaning, even at the cost of comfort or rationality. We seek:

Moral freedom, even if it brings suffering.

Transcendence through faith, love, or sacrifice.

Rebellion against systems that strip us of individuality.

Suffering, not masochistically, but because it can lead to insight, redemption, or self-awareness.


He believed that without spiritual depth, man becomes bored and self-destructive—even in paradise. In essence, Dostoevsky sees humans as souls in search of something eternal, not merely bodies craving ease.

Would you like quotes from his books that show this in action?











If you follow the voice of the most true adventure, 
You'll become a blessing to yourself.
That's a good deal, because people usually live at odds with themselves.

You should attend to the spirit of the most true adventure that calls you out of your comfort zone. If you do that and make necessary sacrifices to follow that path, then the following things will occur to you;-
1) your life will be a blessing to yourself , because you will not be living at odds with yourself anymore 
2) everyone will hold you in high esteem 
3) you'll establish something of permenent value 
4) and you'll do all of it in a way that is maximally beneficial to everyone else 



So what is the most true adventure?

- Ans) There is no distinction between the most true adventure of life and taking on the pathway of maximal responsibility and burden.
- it is the hardest possible available adventure voluntarily understand 

So I say to life, bring it on. Welcome all the struggle the whole way, never shrinking away.


You can't blame your misery on your failure, you can only learn from your failure.
If you blame your misery on your failures then you invite envy and resentment in your heart .

So practice gratitude and humility in face of failure. For adversaries are always in the path of advancement.

Discriminating between a challenge and an opportunity is very very difficult.
And learning to see a challenge as an opportunity, that's the beginning of wisdom.

16) the road of excess leads the place of wisdom. So it's better to through yourself at excess in a young age, then you understand boundaries, good, evil.
17) many people who never break rules are not moral, they are just cowardly 
18) Are you intimidated into obedience or are you a moral agent.
19) Nietzsche will to power is not at all the Marxist ideology of trying to attain power just for the sake of exploiting it. Instead Nietzsche will to power is the implicit desire to manifest the full range of your abilities.

32) Aren't you happier if you just don't look at the terrors of life? Well maybe for a short term you may avoid suffering but it will only make you emptier with time, if you don't try to provide answers to that what in you asks for the truth.
33) there are things that we take for granted, then there are things that we don't even know we take for granted , if pursuit of truth is worthwhile for you maybe you will become aware of these things that you might rather take for granted. and maybe you shouldn't if for you the ignorance is bliss.
34) The pathway to virtue is not necessarily just seperation from darkness.
35) If you are a productive and generous person, people around you will see it and it will become your reputation. And more and more people around you would want to work and trade with you once your reputation is set as someone who is fairly generous in sharing what he have, and efficient in his work so he has much to share. Then more and more people would want to align themselves with you and as a result more and more opportunities will come your way.

**On the Uniqueness of Individuals—and the Ever-Changing Self Within:**

You can't step into the same river twice. But we usually walk on bridges rather than stepping into rivers, so from our perspective, the river appears to remain the same.

However, if you are a regular observer, watching the river from a distance while standing on the bridge, you might notice the color of the water, the depth of the river, and the speed of its flow. You might conclude that this is what the river is. And in some sense, that's true—at least enough for you to put it in some category. But that is not the actual truth of the river.

we form an idea of what the river is, and in doing so, we simplify it. We name it, define it, place it in a category. And while this helps us make sense of it, it is not the whole truth.

Look closer, and the illusion of permanence dissolves. Every drop that flows past is distinct—never to return, never to be touched again in the same place or time. The river is a process, not a thing. It is becoming, always.

So, too, are we.
Humans—and their consciousness—are like that river, too.


The human being—our thoughts, our feelings, our very sense of self—is no less a river. We are not who we were a moment ago, we are different people in today, tomorrow, next week, next year, next decade, in next 50 years. And yet, we construct the illusion of a stable "I" in order to walk our bridges—to navigate life.

But if we dare to look within, with the same depth of observation, we find a current ever-shifting, never still. The true self, like the river, eludes capture. It can only be witnessed in motion.

And like a river you will never meet the same person twice.

When you think of this, then the next question arises. If this is the truth of our human nature then why and how would you expect yourself to live someone else's story, life , destiny.

The will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture, that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken with respect- what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, wicked, questionable questions! That is a long story even now-and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun.

Is it any wonder that we should finally become suspicious, lose patience, and turn away impatiently?

That we should finally learn from this Sphinx to ask questions, too? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? **What in us really wants 'truth'?**

**THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH-SEEKING IS THE SPIRIT THAT HAS ANIMATED ALL PHILOSOPHERS**

THE AIM OF **THE QUESTION** IS THE FACILITATION OF **THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH**

IF YOU ATTEND TO YOUR SHORTCOMINGS AND MAKE A PUBLIC ACCOUNT OF THEM THEN FORMULATE YOUR INTENT TO RECTIFY THEM THAT WOULD BE REDEMPTIVE

Indeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause of this will-until we finally came to a complete stop before a still more basic question, We asked about the value of this will. **Suppose we want truth: why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth.**

The fundamental faith of the metaphysicians is the faith in opposite values. It has not even occurred to the most cautious among them that one might have a doubt right here at the threshold where it was surely most necessary-even if they vowed to themselves, 'de omnibus dubitandum.'

For all the value that the true, the truthful, the selfless may deserve, it would still be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and lust.

"GREAT MEN ARE SELDOM CREDITED FOR THEIR STUPIDITY"

ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULD RID THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE OF THEIR WEAKNESSES?  ; you can't, even if you think you can . All you can do is provide them with enough opposition/adversary that may help them develop their skill and grow stronger in time. Just like a coach helping a player getting better at the game they play by slightly increasing the strength of the player's adversary, slightly increasing the competition all the time.

NIETZSCHE PUTS PHILOSOPHY FORWARD AS A CALL TO ROMANTIC ADVENTURE , to seek out beauty, truth and truest form of life's adventure.


IS THERE SUCH A THING AS THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH THAT ISN'T ACCOMPANIED BY THE SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE?

THE VOLUNTARY CONFRONTATION WITH THE CATASTROPHE OF YOUR LIFE IS PREFERRED OVER MINDLESS INFANTILE SECURITY

PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THAT THEY JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY ARE WAY MORE INTERESTED IN NOT SUFFERING

**HAPPINESS**:- ENGAGED EXCITEMENT

DO YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY OR HAVE A WORTHWHILE ADVENTURE?

IT COULD EASILY BE THAT MOST THINKING IS INSTINCTIVE

After having looked long enough between the philosopher's lines and fingers, I say to myself: by far the greater part of conscious thinking must still be included among instinctive activities, and that goes even for philosophical thinking.

WHAT YOU REGARD AS SELF-EVIDENT ABOUT TRUTH IS NOT SO SELF-EVIDENT

IF YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF IN A WAY THAT OTHERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU, IT MIGHT BE A MORAL FAILING; 
ENABLING EXPLOITATIVE PEOPLE HINDERS YOUR LIGHT FROM SHINING

THE REASON WE VALUE STORIES IS BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK AT

Accordingly, I do not believe that a 'drive to knowledge' is the father of philosophy; but rather that another drive has, here as elsewhere, employed understanding (and misunderstanding) as a mere instrument.

THE IDEA THAT WE SEEK A SECURE BALANCE PRESUMES AN OPTIMAL NORMALITY;
THAT NOTION DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH

CONSCIOUSNESS FUNCTIONS AND INTENSIFIES ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL EDGE, it grows when you live and work on the edge of your comfort bubble trying to always move forward.

Physiologists should think before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength-life itself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results.



IT MIGHT BE THE EMERGENT WILL TO UNIFY & DOMINATE THAT'S THE WILL TO POWER



# 21 April

There are usually men who create for themselves a very narrow view of what is masculine, who usually believe everything that is creative, like singing, make-up/art , and other forms of creativity are feminine.
Some of them who then go into transitioning as a women, who call themselves drag queen's usually dressing as women, and they get an element of sexual kick from it , and dressing like the feminine is interpreted by them as creative and that they think is how they feel.
Where the bottom line is they are creative men who regard all the creativity is feminine so they try to become a women.
The drive to creativity in them is so intense that it incorporates sexuality, and usually that is the case for any creative endeavours but it is not just limited to the feminine.
You can think about this behaviour as a psycho drama, it doesn't mean that they are women.

Masculinity also include: kindness, pity, sympathy and creativity .

Femininity also include: intimidating, physically strong, competitive in play/sports , fierce.

Even though people usually exclude these above features for both respective genders
These lines of featuristic division are not much clear for women, these days then they are for men. Because women are allowed to be more like what was considered masculine, then men are allowed to be like what was considered feminine.



If someone(even yourself) poses a question to you, the question begs the answer.
There is a hint in the question about what you are required to accept as a certainty before you move ahead with its discussion.
One of the dangers of that is, 
if you answer a question without questioning the question , then you accept the frame of reference that the question places on your actions of responses.
And since you don't have a whole wide view of the argument, and just a little frame of reference that was provided to you initially, you would loose the argument/answer even before it gets off of the ground.











Where does thoughts come from, we think that "I think" , that is every thought that I have I created it. But it's not true because if you could create your thoughts, you wouldn't need to think to find it in your mind, it won't come to you. 
And if you could create your thoughts than you would know what you would think 50 years from now or what you thought 10 years ago that you right now do not remember.
And so if we do not know how we think than "everything is questionable"
That's a lot of uncertainty and doubt that is very anxiety provoking .
But it also is rife with possibilities.

So the pragmatic engineers definition of truth will be :-
As long as your simplification Of truth works for the purpose of your current operation it's sufficient 

in essence this is the conception of human beings for "the truth" as engineers, we presume that something is true if it works well enough for now.

Like if a code works well enough for now and application doesn't have error, so it's a bug free system. Good enough then we move onto the next Question.

But since we are ignorant that's why in future or present at some point the system will fail. So we make an expiry date for everything we create, since "The Truth" can never be changed or expire. We know we do not have "The Truth". So there can't be "The Bug free system" .

Everything is always only 'true enough', nothing can ever be the truth because you are ignorant and your knowledge is bounded by it, the best you can have is a fragmentry truth that has a bounded range of applicability.


So testing an engineered system/structure, inherently means searching for truth(i.e we are searching for the truth of the engineered structure) . But we limit that search of "the truth" to the extent that is , for the purpose of your current operation is the structure/system sufficient (if it works well enough for now) .

But the theory behind any engineering can never be correct in an infinite sense, because it's bounded by ignorance (i.e we are ignorant for even how our thoughts originated).

So the question while testing is reduced to something very practical from that to "finding what is the truth of the engineered structure":- to this
"Does it serves the purpose for intended period of time".


----

Certainty is the biggest disease of our time.
The need to know everything for sure , being binary, either it is a 0 or 1 nothing else in between. This idea is corrupting us from the inside, we need to let go of this obsession of having control over everything we touch.



Don't edit when you are writing and producing thoughts, 
Write down everything you think about the topic.
If you don't have anything to think, pick a different topic that you might be interested in.
And write down everything you can think about it, if you still don't have any thoughts on the topic.
Read about the subject, study it and then start producing your own work.
Don't think about what you are thinking when writing and producing thoughts, let it flow by itself.
Get all the types of ideas written down, anything and everything.

Then Take a break come back and do the editing, separating the weed from the chaff. 

This works neurotically because the part of our brain that produces thoughts and the part that refines things are different and they can't work to there full potential if you are running them against each other during the writing and producing flow .


Give your self a moral freedom from perfection, whatever you try do in life and then fail miserably, allow your self to do that thing stupidly 50 times before you get it right. After that you become good at it and with enough repetition you may achieve mystery and excellence in it.

You repat 80% of what you do everyday for the rest of your life. Think about how you can optimise all of that 80% so you do it better, and make even the things that you think are dull, boring and mundane as intresting and fun to you as you would like.



Naive -->encounter malevolence --> devlope cynicism --> then the cynic grows and mature --> devlope the capability of courageous trust, that is to believe there is good in everyone they encounter and they can try and bring it out in people while simultaneously those people do the same for them.

Note:- even though we may think cynicism is an evil emotion , it's a devlopment from the naivete.
For now the person can see the malevolence in the world and see the good and evil. But the cynics are more tilted towards the criticism end of the world view and that may even degenerate into paranoid world view.

Philosophy is a systematic inquiry into fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, ethics, and reality.
Even in the world of fast science and tech advancements, philosophy is important because philosophy is open-ended, skeptical, and not confined to just the materialistic questions science addresses. Unlike science, which disrupts false beliefs through experimentation, philosophy explores possibilities and their implications through reflective inquiry.

Philosophy is needed to bring in the perspectives of these fast paced  materialistic changes on our civilization and discuss its direction. Philosophers are vital to society because they challenge assumptions, clarify values, and guide ethical decision-making in a complex world. By debating questions of morality, justice, and meaning, they provide frameworks to navigate issues like AI ethics, climate responsibility, or social inequality, areas where science alone falls short.

# 26-4-24

A blanket ingratitude about the past and a blanket condemnation of what went before us, it's ungrateful in the extreme.
The people who think that, also simultaneously think that somehow merely standing as critics they are morally superior than everyone who went before them in the past .


An easier life for everyone, is that really what anyone wants. I don't think so and Certainly not the philosopher's 
We rather are searching something Nobel, something beyond infantilised heard like desire for comfort and an easier life.
To live a great life you must always strive for an optimised difficulty , rather than ease.

Like the ideal of beauty, if you can't match the ideal , and are not beautiful enough according to those standard. Doesn't mean you have to end the ideal of beauty, you should rather try to become beautiful by exercising, or be greatful of other ideals that you have like maybe you are more intelligent, wiser, have love,

All our inadequacy gives us pain in relation to the ideals,
But that doesn't mean you get rid of the ideals, 
It means you try to get rid of those inadequacy  or be greatful or be humble.

Also without an ideal nothing unites us humans, because then we don't have a purpose or a goal to strive for, there is no scale that will indicate your inadequacy and you won't bother trying to grow and become better in order to surpass the criteria to be included in that ideal .

(eg: ideal of beauty, people exercising together to become beautiful and strong. ; ideal of love: people going out on dates and creating different ways to find and meet people who they might be intrested in whom they might find beautiful whom they believe they may fall in love with, ideal of wisdom: community coming together studying, teaching, sharing knowledge and information in order to help eachother become more wiser and help their fellows become wiser along with them)

Without an ideal nothing unites us, because you have no purpose to strive for and unite your will behind it. You have no hope because hope comes from you striving for an ideal and following your will to the ideals of your choice, and that brings you hope for in future when you achieve that ideal you will be a better , stronger, happier human being.

Same theory applies not only on unity of human society but also on the unity of our mind. If a person doesn't have an ideal to follow, doesn't have a will to an ideal they say "I don't know what to do with my life". Because you are not United in your self since you don't have an aim to move unitedly towards at. So different parts of you fall into Chaos going in different direction that is when you call a person "purposeless".

the purpose is the only thing each human wants to keep on living . And the purpose comes from will of the person, wanting to achieve an ideal in this life, that is how humans keep on moving forward and keep growing.

Therefore embracing struggle means finding what is your "will to an ideal", which ideal are you willing to aim at, strive for and achieve in your life.
Once you have that , every thing in you and out you is united for moving you towards that ideal. That brings purpose to your life. 

No ideals mean no purpose, it means you are lost and doomed to anxiety and hopeless and to the judgement of society.

Following an ideal mean , having an inner voice that feels like judgement telling you, you are not good enough , since it's comparing you to that ideal you want to achieve.
But it also means you are embracing struggle to get better and grow continuously to achieve that ideal.

So you may choose which struggle and suffering you may adopt in your life. 
The suffering of a life without purpose or 
The suffering of continuous overcoming in order to achieve the ideal. That is very possible you may never will.

---

You don't want to protect people from suffering and struggle.
You want to encourage them to be that sort of people who can voluntarily take on their suffering.

That helps them to become brave. Rather than feeling secure. 

----

Learning is taking the fraction of infinite that we haven't yet mastered.
Reducing it to the point where it's still a challenge, but not an overwhelming challenge and then voluntarily facing it.
That is the process of adaptation of struggle, of embracing struggle.

You have to very careful calibrate the rate at which you expose yourself the people you are in a relationship with to the terror of the world . And for each individual it's going to be different. You understand yourself and your people to know where their edge is, and then you put them on that edge every time or as much as they can manage to help them grow with you.

This also helps see what's actually dangerous and what's just frightening.

This act helps us to manifest the capacity of adapting change as rapidly as possible.

We must strive to "suffer in such a noble way that it may even justify suffering". That is the ideal I want to achieve.
Because 
I can't accept that because there is intolerable suffering in this world. The compassionate thing to do is just stop the being.
These kind of excessive compassion is more than murderous, it's anti-being.

And these excessive situations arises because Compassion as become the single unquestionable virtue .

But there is something better a virtue, 
Encouragement; even though it's looks harsh in the sense , the one who is encouraging has to use the force to help the other person push themselves and grow.
Encouragement has a meta-compassion embedded in it.
It's like I know what you could be and I am on the side of that. 

Eg: the patriarchal encouragement, like the stance of a father towards their Son, a father doesn't have that maternal love of "I love you the way you are", it says,  I can see around 5 place where you are lacking right now and I know you are capable of becoming better, so get the hell out there work hard , even struggle if you have to. But come back a better man.

That patriarchal encouragement is better than the protective compassion , which degenerates into excessive compassion.


Make a contract with people, A condition before helping them,
That I am on the side of you that wants to be better for yourself and everyone else.

 The unconditional can be
 "I will listen to everything you have to say, that you can express a"

But the best in me will be serving the best in you .
