Adversity always lies in the path of advancement, most would run from it but I would Walk through it,
That is why destiny chose me to lead.


What holds more truth, history or prophecy?


Man with no purpose devices only mischief.

Lying, do you know what that makes a man..
A criminal ?
A sociopath ?

A survivor.
