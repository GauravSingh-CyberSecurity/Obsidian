Adversity always lies in the path of advancement, most would run from it but I would Walk through it,
That is why destiny chose me to lead.


What holds more truth, history or prophecy?


Man with no purpose devices only mischief.







Lying, do you know what that makes a man..
A criminal ?
A sociopath ?

A survivor.
Hunan beings rely on lies to survive,
We lie to our enemies.
We lie to our friends.
We lie to ourselves.

Lying is among the most sophisticated task our brain can perform.

Because for most of us, we don't like to lie, 
body rejects it. How does it do tha?

Pupils dilate, changes in breathing, expression on eyebrows.

All of them are signs that we work to perceive truth saying.









He is a man of focus, commitment and shear fucking will.




Humans are odd,
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings,
I think they missed that .
They are doomed, but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts .
It's a privilege to be among them.




I won't overlook their transgressions anymore.



People act like these thinking machines are something different than us. They are us

A master has failed more than an amature ever tried.





Fyodor Dostoevsky, through his works—especially Notes from Underground, The Brothers Karamazov, and Crime and Punishment—presents a profound and often unsettling view of human nature.

He challenges the Enlightenment idea that human beings primarily desire a rational, comfortable, and fulfilled life. Instead, Dostoevsky argues that man is not simply a creature of reason, but of irrationality, contradiction, and spiritual struggle.

On Fulfillment and Comfort:

In Notes from Underground, the narrator mockingly critiques the idea that if all human needs were met—if people lived in a “crystal palace” of logic and comfort—they would be satisfied. Dostoevsky writes:

> "Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering... Man likes to make roads, but he also likes to break them down."



In other words, even when offered a fulfilled life—peace, comfort, pleasure—humans often rebel. Why? Because we crave freedom, even if it leads to chaos or destruction. We don’t want to be predictable machines; we want to feel we choose our path, even if it’s irrational.

What Are Humans Actually Pursuing?

Dostoevsky suggests that what humans truly pursue is meaning, even at the cost of comfort or rationality. We seek:

Moral freedom, even if it brings suffering.

Transcendence through faith, love, or sacrifice.

Rebellion against systems that strip us of individuality.

Suffering, not masochistically, but because it can lead to insight, redemption, or self-awareness.


He believed that without spiritual depth, man becomes bored and self-destructive—even in paradise. In essence, Dostoevsky sees humans as souls in search of something eternal, not merely bodies craving ease.

Would you like quotes from his books that show this in action?











If you follow the voice of the most true adventure, 
You'll become a blessing to yourself.
That's a good deal, because people usually live at odds with themselves.

You should attend to the spirit of the most true adventure that calls you out of your comfort zone. If you do that and make necessary sacrifices to follow that path, then the following things will occur to you;-
1) your life will be a blessing to yourself , because you will not be living at odds with yourself anymore 
2) everyone will hold you in high esteem 
3) you'll establish something of permenent value 
4) and you'll do all of it in a way that is maximally beneficial to everyone else 



So what is the most true adventure?

- Ans) There is no distinction between the most true adventure of life and taking on the pathway of maximal responsibility and burden.
- it is the hardest possible available adventure voluntarily understand 

So I say to life, bring it on. Welcome all the struggle the whole way, never shrinking away.


You can't blame your misery on your failure, you can only learn from your failure.
If you blame your misery on your failures then you invite envy and resentment in your heart .

So practice gratitude and humility in face of failure. For adversaries are always in the path of advancement.

Discriminating between a challenge and an opportunity is very very difficult.
And learning to see a challenge as an opportunity, that's the beginning of wisdom.
