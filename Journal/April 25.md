Adversity always lies in the path of advancement, most would run from it but I would Walk through it,
That is why destiny chose me to lead.


What holds more truth, history or prophecy?


Man with no purpose devices only mischief.







Lying, do you know what that makes a man..
A criminal ?
A sociopath ?

A survivor.
Hunan beings rely on lies to survive,
We lie to our enemies.
We lie to our friends.
We lie to ourselves.

Lying is among the most sophisticated task our brain can perform.

Because for most of us, we don't like to lie, 
body rejects it. How does it do tha?

Pupils dilate, changes in breathing, expression on eyebrows.

All of them are signs that we work to perceive truth saying.









He is a man of focus, commitment and shear fucking will.




Humans are odd,
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings,
I think they missed that .
They are doomed, but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts .
It's a privilege to be among them.




I won't overlook their transgressions anymore.



People act like these thinking machines are something different than us. They are us

A master has failed more than an amature ever tried.





Fyodor Dostoevsky, through his works—especially Notes from Underground, The Brothers Karamazov, and Crime and Punishment—presents a profound and often unsettling view of human nature.

He challenges the Enlightenment idea that human beings primarily desire a rational, comfortable, and fulfilled life. Instead, Dostoevsky argues that man is not simply a creature of reason, but of irrationality, contradiction, and spiritual struggle.

On Fulfillment and Comfort:

In Notes from Underground, the narrator mockingly critiques the idea that if all human needs were met—if people lived in a “crystal palace” of logic and comfort—they would be satisfied. Dostoevsky writes:

> "Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering... Man likes to make roads, but he also likes to break them down."



In other words, even when offered a fulfilled life—peace, comfort, pleasure—humans often rebel. Why? Because we crave freedom, even if it leads to chaos or destruction. We don’t want to be predictable machines; we want to feel we choose our path, even if it’s irrational.

What Are Humans Actually Pursuing?

Dostoevsky suggests that what humans truly pursue is meaning, even at the cost of comfort or rationality. We seek:

Moral freedom, even if it brings suffering.

Transcendence through faith, love, or sacrifice.

Rebellion against systems that strip us of individuality.

Suffering, not masochistically, but because it can lead to insight, redemption, or self-awareness.


He believed that without spiritual depth, man becomes bored and self-destructive—even in paradise. In essence, Dostoevsky sees humans as souls in search of something eternal, not merely bodies craving ease.

Would you like quotes from his books that show this in action?











If you follow the voice of the most true adventure, 
You'll become a blessing to yourself.
That's a good deal, because people usually live at odds with themselves.

You should attend to the spirit of the most true adventure that calls you out of your comfort zone. If you do that and make necessary sacrifices to follow that path, then the following things will occur to you;-
1) your life will be a blessing to yourself , because you will not be living at odds with yourself anymore 
2) everyone will hold you in high esteem 
3) you'll establish something of permenent value 
4) and you'll do all of it in a way that is maximally beneficial to everyone else 



So what is the most true adventure?

- Ans) There is no distinction between the most true adventure of life and taking on the pathway of maximal responsibility and burden.
- it is the hardest possible available adventure voluntarily understand 

So I say to life, bring it on. Welcome all the struggle the whole way, never shrinking away.


You can't blame your misery on your failure, you can only learn from your failure.
If you blame your misery on your failures then you invite envy and resentment in your heart .

So practice gratitude and humility in face of failure. For adversaries are always in the path of advancement.

Discriminating between a challenge and an opportunity is very very difficult.
And learning to see a challenge as an opportunity, that's the beginning of wisdom.

Then more and more people would want to align themselves with you and as a result more and more opportunities will come your way.

**On the Uniqueness of Individuals—and the Ever-Changing Self Within:**

You can't step into the same river twice. But we usually walk on bridges rather than stepping into rivers, so from our perspective, the river appears to remain the same.

However, if you are a regular observer, watching the river from a distance while standing on the bridge, you might notice the color of the water, the depth of the river, and the speed of its flow. You might conclude that this is what the river is. And in some sense, that's true—at least enough for you to put it in some category. But that is not the actual truth of the river.

we form an idea of what the river is, and in doing so, we simplify it. We name it, define it, place it in a category. And while this helps us make sense of it, it is not the whole truth.

Look closer, and the illusion of permanence dissolves. Every drop that flows past is distinct—never to return, never to be touched again in the same place or time. The river is a process, not a thing. It is becoming, always.

So, too, are we.
Humans—and their consciousness—are like that river, too.


The human being—our thoughts, our feelings, our very sense of self—is no less a river. We are not who we were a moment ago, we are different people in today, tomorrow, next week, next year, next decade, in next 50 years. And yet, we construct the illusion of a stable "I" in order to walk our bridges—to navigate life.

But if we dare to look within, with the same depth of observation, we find a current ever-shifting, never still. The true self, like the river, eludes capture. It can only be witnessed in motion.

And like a river you will never meet the same person twice.

When you think of this, then the next question arises. If this is the truth of our human nature then why and how would you expect yourself to live someone else's story, life , destiny.

The will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture, that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken with respect- what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, wicked, questionable questions! That is a long story even now-and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun.

Is it any wonder that we should finally become suspicious, lose patience, and turn away impatiently?

That we should finally learn from this Sphinx to ask questions, too? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? **What in us really wants 'truth'?**

**THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH-SEEKING IS THE SPIRIT THAT HAS ANIMATED ALL PHILOSOPHERS**

THE AIM OF **THE QUESTION** IS THE FACILITATION OF **THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH**

IF YOU ATTEND TO YOUR SHORTCOMINGS AND MAKE A PUBLIC ACCOUNT OF THEM THEN FORMULATE YOUR INTENT TO RECTIFY THEM THAT WOULD BE REDEMPTIVE

Indeed we came to a long halt at the question about the cause of this will-until we finally came to a complete stop before a still more basic question, We asked about the value of this will. **Suppose we want truth: why not rather untruth? and uncertainty? even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth.**

The fundamental faith of the metaphysicians is the faith in opposite values. It has not even occurred to the most cautious among them that one might have a doubt right here at the threshold where it was surely most necessary-even if they vowed to themselves, 'de omnibus dubitandum.'

For all the value that the true, the truthful, the selfless may deserve, it would still be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and lust.

"GREAT MEN ARE SELDOM CREDITED FOR THEIR STUPIDITY"

ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULD RID THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE OF THEIR WEAKNESSES?  ; you can't, even if you think you can . All you can do is provide them with enough opposition/adversary that may help them develop their skill and grow stronger in time. Just like a coach helping  getting better at the game they play by slightly increasing the strength of thier adversary
