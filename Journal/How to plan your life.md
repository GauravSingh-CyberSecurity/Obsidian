# **01_Between Order and chaos**

1) **Vison and plan: Theory and practice** 
A **vison** presents a broad theory , while a **plan** translates that vison into focused, implementable action. The journey from concept to action drives meaningful change.

A person who is psychologycally and philosophically informed, needs all that broader vision of philosophy and need to learn to take it and focus it and implement it in your own life .

Abstract ideas become meaningful when they are implementable, that is "Philosophical implementation: making ideas work"

You'll always have a vison in life a good or a bad.

You are governed by your vision.
As much as you may say practically you are possesd by it


**Daoist worldview**: ==Beyond material reality== . The Daoist perspective views the world not as purely material but as composed of both matter and information - transcending reductive materialism.

**Chaos and order** : The Yin-Yang symbol depicts two serpents, black representing chaos and white representing order, embodying primordial cosmic forces.



**Understanding and Potential**: 
The Domains of Experience
What you understand is order; what you don't understand is chaos, which contains the potential for new discoveries and self-transformation.



**The Tyrannical Mindset**: Rejecting Transformation, self oppression 


**Childlike Openness**
Children naturally approach the unknown with exploration and discovery, an attitude often shattered by trauma, resulting in cynicism rather than growth.


**Conceptual territories:** 
Beyond physical territories, humans inhabit conceptual environments with familiar domains and unexplored frontiers of knowledge.

**The edge of understanding** : intellectual curiosity.  

You get intrested in something when you are put on the edge of what you know about the thing.


**Engagement enables growth** : 
Phenomenological Experience; engagement happens when we're at boundary of what we know, signaling the ideal moment for transformation and growth.

**Meaning**: in the sense of human life, is optimised learning, growing and transformation 

Eg: **Music as meaning** : (it's a balance between order and chaos)
Beyond Nihilism; Music reflects the balance of chaos and order, showing that the meaning arises from their interplay and affirming that meaning is woven into very structure of existence.

Like a **rap music** has some predictability (order) in its flow, beats, beat dropping that order affirms that the song is a rap song, then there is unpredictablity (chaos) in the songs lyrics, and we as a listeners do not know what the artist is going to say in their lyrics when the beat drops.

Life is a symphony made up of these notes of order and chaos that brings out a meaningful music. That creates the song of life.


**Order** (==intention shaping outcomes==) :
The domain of order is where actions align with intentions, resulting in expected outcomes.

The **Border between Order And Chaos**: where meaning emerges

**The Edge of Transformation** (Balancing safety and growth) :
Growth occurs with one foot in predictability and the other in unknown - Secure enough to act, yet open to beneficial change.



**Beyond winning:** growth vs victory 

- You don't wanna keep winning the game at level 1 all the time.
- You want to keep progressing forward when playing any game, and keep moving to the next level, to harder opponent, tougher challenge . In order to keep the game engaging, intersting. Because that challenge brings the real meaning to the winning. That feeling of growth brings the meaning to your victory.



**Haunting memories** : Unresolved past trauma return involuntarily, destabilizing us potentially to the severity of original experience.


**The instinctual warning system** (Psychological protection) 
Our psyche recalls past dangers to motivate adaptive growth, presenting them as warning of potential threats we haven't yet learned to handle.

**Preventing Recurrence** : identify and strength.


**Finding your Contribution** : when conflicts arise, identifying your contribution, even if small, gives you a control point for resolution and personal growth.


**Manageable change**: 
(Rate of Transformation)
When change feels overwhelming, find an Optimal pace. Breaking large transformation into smaller steps makes growth sustainable.


**Carl Jung on Transformation** : 
(The foolish beginnings)
Jung observed that the fool is the precursor to the savior, highlighting that meaningful change requires accepting initial imperfection and inadequacy.

Doing something even stupidly and badly is better than pure avoidance.


**The value of imperfect progress** :
It is much much higher than pure avoidance. This concept is called "beyond avoidance", to allow yourself and people to do something badly instead of them/you purely avoiding the task in fear of miserable failure.


**The Mathematics of intimacy** (long term perspective) :
Early awkward steps are only a small part of a large equation. Regular interaction add up, leading to gradual growth and mastery. (And this applies to everything you do , not just your intimate relationships.)

Most of the things, almost 80% that you do in your life are going to be repetitive in your  day-to-day life.
So if you are willing to let yourself stumble forward when you are improving things that repeat, if you allow yourself that space for play and error then you can learn to incrementally master that task in a manner that enables you to become a master over the long run.

Advice: Allow yourself to do something repetitive in your life badly  atleast 50-200 times. Depending on the ratio of the repetition of that particular task.
Like dating, job hunting, producing thoughts while writing and philosophising , studying and learning, giving tests and exams on a particular subject you find meaningful and purposeful.



==**Everyday Excellence**:== 
We downplay repeated experiences and act as they are less crucial, mundane even. Despite their dominance in shaping our lives. Daily interactions deserve more attention than rare exceptional events.

Eg: going to work and coming back home, this task is repetitive but considered mundane. Now I can create/find ways to do it excellently as per myself. Like listening to an audiobook, producing thoughts and writing in my journal, do critical thinking , listening to music and vibing etc. there are a lot of ways by which we can incrementally transform this everyday repetitive mundane task into an excellent life experience.



**Life's hidden mathematics** :
(The 5% solution)
20 minutes daily adds up to 5% of your life, 
and mastering 20 such routines/task that are repeated in your day can transform your entire existence.

Keep trying to do all repetitive and non repetitive things better everyday incrementally, don't settle thinking you have achieved perfection, mastery or excellence.


If you don't forge carefully with intention the daily tasks/encounters, you will find yourself feeling like you are stuck in a vicious cycle. And all your life is nothing but things you don't like.



**Disappointment in exceptions** :
Overhauling special occasions 


==**Play is Freedom** (The Antidote to tyranny) :==
Play represents the opposite of tyrannical power, the ability to master situations with joy rather than control, transforming obligations into opportunities.


**The Martyrdom Trap** :
Enduring hardship while blaming others for your situation create a martyr complex that transfers responsibility while indulging in self-righteousness .


**The Unfinished Path** : 
Confronting past decisions, Examining why you abandoned goals within reach reveals whether past limitations still affect you or if you have outgrown former obstacles.

Try to give answer to this question: Why should someone hire you?
**The value proposition** : Articulating your worth.

**Identifying paralysis points** : (Breaking through fear)
List and rank your fears to identify what's preventing forward motion, then break overwhelming obstacles into manageable steps to increase your chance of progress.


**Supportive relationships** :
(Choosing growth partners)
The people around you should recognise your progress, not diminish it. Evaluate relationship by how they respond to your achievements.


You wanna be with people who know your progress forward, and atleast don't get in the way and that includes yourself.

For those who have everything, more will be given. From those who have nothing, everything will be taken.

Even if you have to start slow, doesn't mean that you are doomed to slow progress.



==**Success Acceleration** :== 
Achivement follows exponential rather linear growth. Each accomplishment makes the next one easier, whether in Finance, creative work, or Skills.





**Opportunity VS Obligation** :
(Mindset shifts) , you don't consider the things that will help you move forward and grow as an obligation, you must shift your mindset and start looking at the factors that may play a part in your growth as opportunities.


**Overcoming Obstacles :**
Effective individuals face the same obstacles as everyone else but refuse to let challenges prevent them from delivering results.


**The Art of Self-promotion** :
Communication, Not Boasting.


**Credit Theft in Organizations** :
(Breaking invisible patterns)
Conscientious workers, especially women, often do essential work while others claim credit, making their visible contribution look like a survival skill, not vanity.



**The Reward Schedule** :
(Personal Motivation Patterns)
Identify the reward frequency that keeps you motivated-whether monthly acknowledgment or daily validation-to sustain satisfaction in relationships and work.


You'll have to let people be stupid , about how they are treating you well to begin with.


**The Power of Recognition** :
Immediately noting when someone does something positive reinforces behavior. Detailed recognition is more powerful than general praise.


**Small Obstacles, Major Impact** :
Disorganization creates mental roadblocks, as small barriers-like a cluttered computer blocking important documents-can prevent significant progress.



# 02_The walled Garden 

 **Encountering Chaos**
It doesn't matter where you encounter chaos, it only matters that you do encounter it.
Any step in the unknown is as good as any other.

**Entering the Darkness**
(A Knight's Journey)

**From Chaos to Clarity**
Retelling painful stories transforms chaotic memories into focused narratives, eventually becoming manageable markers for future navigation.



**Gender Differences in Threat Detection**

**Ancient Wisdom on Self-Examination**
Religious practices of confession and repentance reflect psychological insights about identifying personal limitations to enable growth.


**The Necessity of Painful Truths**
Growth Through Discomfort



**Parental Boundaries**
(The Purpose of Child Discipline)
Parents must guide children's behavior not to suppress their spirit but to help them succeed in broader social contexts.



**The Critical Age of Four**
(Window for Social Integration)
Aggressive tendencies in young boys can be channeled into positive traits by age four through socialization that transforms rather than suppresses.


**Rules as Enablers**
(Reframing Discipline as Opportunity)
Rules aren't limitations imposed from outside but enabling principles that allow for more sophisticated engagement with life's complexity.


**Strategic Scheduling**
Designing Your Ideal Day


**Unknown Self**
(Challenging Self-Perception)
Developing a vision requires dismissing assumptions about yourself, approaching your own desires with the same curiosity you'd offer someone else.



**The Origins of Unhappiness**
Profound unhappiness often stems from internalized harsh judgments of parts of yourself that you don't fully understand.



**Relationship Vulnerability**
(The Risk of Revealing Needs)
In relationships, revealing what would please you gives others power to satisfy or deny those needs, making trust essential.



**Faith and Courage**
Twin Virtues for Growth



**The cost of Avoidance**

**The power of Truth-Telling**
Non-confrontational Honesty.


**Strategic preparedness** 
(The paradox of courage)
Being prepared for worst-case scenario creates the psychological safety needed to initiate difficult conversations with confidence.


**Job Satisfaction Assessment**

**The Domain of Chaos** 
Our realm of ignorance vastly exceeds our knowledge; understanding how to function effectively despite this imbalance is crucial for survival.


**The structure of Safety**
We Establish boundaries, both physically and psychologically, creating frameworks that help manage the overwhelming complexity of existence.


**Paradise as Constraint**
The ideal environment provides protection while balancing chaos and order.



**Constrained optimization** 
(Mathematics of happiness)
Surplus of choice makes people miserable , if you make sure you have fewer choices, then you pick one of them. You will be much more satisfied because you will have a higher chance that you picked the best possible choice.


**Nested protection** 
Layers of security.


In the intellectual plain, the preconditions are the walls that provides security.
Eg: like the city "Carcassonne, France"
We have multiple layers of wall(preconditions) , and we intellectuals sit behind these multiple layers of walls that keeps almost all chaos out, so that we can sit in there and deal with the little amount of chaos that our individual intellect can handle.






The Natural state of mankind is Chaos, requiring social structure for protection and order.
**- Thomas hobbes**(metaphysical author).
Basically Hobbes says: that humans  naturally exists in a form of chaotic nightmare . And society provides them protection and structure from these chaos so that we can work/function in a proper order.

On the other hand 

**The Rousseauian perspective** 
Jean-jacques Rousseau argued that humans possess intrinsic goodness, which becomes distorted by societal structures, highlighting the paradox of protection.



**Conceptual walls**
(Psychological protection systems)
These are the pre-supposition that we hold to be true, about how the world is constituted. And they keep the chaos at bay.
Eg: in a relationship, our assumption that our partner is faithful.


**The Totality of Betrayal** 
Betrayal erase not only the present and the future but also rewrites the past, turning certainty into Chaos and leaving victims questioning their entire history.

If you betray someone, you violate your trust and your ability to form a relationship. 
And maybe the betrayers do that because they want to enjoy the freedom that comes along with betrayal that feeling of no obligation, but the price they pay is; they reveal themselves to themselves as someone too unreliable to make the long term commitment necessary for a stable life. That's a hell of a price to pay and maybe they'll never recover from that.
This is why betrayers are put at the bottom most part of hell by Dante in his painting of hell.



**Incremental Progress** 
When facing overwhelming tasks, create manageable boundaries by allocating small consistent time periods with minimal initial expectations.
Eg: write every day for some time, and increase it incrementally.


**Constraint Reduction** 
(Overcoming creative barriers)
Removing unnecessary constraints helps overcoming initial resistance until momentum naturally develop towards improvement.


You write to discover, what is it that you have to say.
It's a great way to know yourself.


**Self-Love Through Achievable Steps**
The psychology of growth.


**The Heroes First Retreat** 
In classic hero stories, initial encounters with threats typically result in retreat, a natural first response before finding courage to stand ground.


**Finding the edge of comfort** 
Curiosity outweighs terror.


**Biblical Etymology** 
(Genesis interpretation) 
The name "Eve" in genesis etymologically means "beneficial adversary" - symbolising the partner in play who challenges us to devlop through mutual growth.



**Marriage as developmental partnership** 
(The Dance of Growth)
The ideal relationship partner pushes you slightly beyond comfort toward devlopment, creating beneficial adversarial dynamics that foster mutual evolution.


**==Creative solution-Finding==** 
(In your relationship)
Instead of settling for a win-loose compromise, honest communication and innovation can lead to an optimised solution - a shared vision that excites both parties.


**The Homecoming ritual**

**Dragons in the Household** 
Address small problems before they grow into unmanageable challenges;
It's the psychological equivalent of slaying household dragons before they turn into man-eating monsters.



**Moses and leadership** 
Biblical model of liberation 
(That'll be the person in you, who'll free you from tyranny and slavery)


**God's command to Moses** 
(DIVINE Instruction)
Moses' failure to lead with words, instead restoring to force, cost him entry into the Promised Land, illustrating the consequences of abandoning persuasion for authority.
(The Fact that you use force at all when you could have used invitation/communication means you don't get to your destination with people), you never let things go so far that force becomes necessary.
You negotiate the best deal and invite people to work with you.
Force is a sub-optimal solution, not an better or an optimised solution, basically not the best/right solution.



**Freedom through Order**
(The paradox of structure)
Getting small details organised creates freedom to respond to exceptional opportunities, like hosting family gatherings without underlying stress or resentment.



# 03_Desire and Discipline

**Perceptual Limitations** 
We hear, see, experience, focus on , what we can. But it's not everything.


**Aldous Huxley**(Author)
A British writer who argued in **The Doors of Perception** that the brain filters reality, limiting perception to make the world manageable.
And infinite wonder is also overwhelming, so you don't see more than you can understand.


**Instinctual intelligence** 
(The body's interpretive Systems)
Our innate emotional structures provide fundamental framework for categorising and understanding the world.


**Motivational states**
Instinctive Goal Direction 
(Eg: instinct of hunger, it tell now most priority task around you is to find food.)
It's not a drive, it's a sophisticated sub-personalities , like that we all have these types of shared motivations. Like self-preservation and reproduction.



**Motivational classification** (Two broad classes)
Self-preservation VS Reproduction 

1) want you to survive and keep going 
2) want you to socialize and reproduce and care for others.


**Childhood devlopment** 
Young kids express motivational states with remarkable purity and intensity, cycling through them with unfiltered authenticity.
(Sometimes even 30 year olds can have these tantrums if not developed)


Inbuilt Motivational states are just good at presenting you the problem, but don't offer solutions.


**Conflicting motivations** 
(Inner Drive Clash)
Motivational Systems guide us, but they don't solve conflicts between competing desires.
(Eg: you hate someone still sexually attracted to them.)

As you grow you need to integrate these conflicting motivational Systems to exist together and still keep you function and even you on your best game.


**Sigmund Freud** 
An Austrian Neurologist who developed psychoanalysis and conceptualized the human personality as shaped by the interactions of the id, ego and superego.(It's intresting but wrong, and interestingly wrong is good to just look at to know what true effort looks like)


**Beyond control to integration** 
Effective negotiation offers better alternatives rather than simply imposing control, helping integrate emotional impulses into socialized behaviour.


**Emotional Integration** 
(From Rage to personality)
Children/adult have to learn to transform raw emotional forces into integrated personalities that maintain social connections despite strong feelings.


**The Emotional Examination** 
Partners (usually female) test each other's temperament, unconsciously assessing emotional regulation and social integration.



**Integrating Development**
(Maturation Beyond Inhibition)
Healthy development transforms raw impulses into sophisticated patterns rather than merely suppressing them through external control.


**The Intrinsic Goal**
Your deepest wants and needs reflect the collective voice of your integrated instincts, guiding your personality toward possibilities that integrate all motivational systems.


**The Voice of Conscience**
(Self-Regulation in Action)
The conscience represents the internal guidance system that calls attention to behaviors that are inconsistent with one's potential for integration.

Our character are made up of:
1) persona : our social image 
2) ego : what we think we are
3) self : everything we are in physical and metaphysical plains.



**Truth and Self-Deception**
(The Cost of Lying)
Lying distorts our relationship with our internal guidance system, programming erroneous patterns that ultimately undermine decision-making abilities



**Elijah the Prophet**

**Meditative Organization**
Mindful Arrangement of Space


**Beyond "Getting Your Act Together"**
Small Habits, Big Impact


**The Golden Rule**

**The Reciprocity Effect**
(Social Investment Returns)
Being of service to others creates reciprocal relationships, positioning you to receive support from multiple sources when you most need it.


**NEO PI-R Inventory**
This five-dimensional personality inventory reveals how self-consciousness and negative emotions consistently cluster together in psychological assessment data.


If you are - your behaviour 
Happy - Talkative 
Angry - sad
Creative - intrested in ideas
Dutiful - patriotic 
==Self concious - miserable== 


The more you think about your narrow self, the more miserable you are.
They are not cousal , self-consciousness doesn't cause misery.
Self-consciousness is misery they are the same thing.
There is no difference between being hyper concern about your immediate self and being miserable.


**Social anxiety solution** 
Shift focus from your own self to others, try to make them comfortable, listen to people. Make others feel welcomed.


![[IMG_20250507_215915.jpg]]


**Emotional reaction to obstacles** 
When pursuing goals, interruption can trigger negative emotions because they are perceived as obstacles to completion.

You don't see worlds as object, the world produce itself as pathways and obstacles to you.


**Hope vs. Satisfaction**
Sustained positive emotion comes from pursuing valued goals. Hope energizes, while satisfaction signals the completion of motivational frames.

**Optimal challenge level** 
You should have a goal, and it should be something you can move towards.
Don't set a goal out of your domain of 
Achievement.
Just set the goal that is slightly difficult and demanding than you can achieve.


Like there as multiple paths to chaos (anywhere outside of the your comfort zone/know circle, wherever you step there is chaos ), similarly there are multiple paths uphill, it's like whichever direction you choose to move towards leaving your domain of comfort and know behind can be the path uphill as good as any, and when you move upwards even if you whither and stumble in wrong direction slowly you will correct your path and direction.
Because no matter what you'll aim at the wrong thing, but even if you aim at wrong thing a few times, because of practicing of aiming, your aim will get better. So don't worry about that too much, pick some intresting disciplinary routine.
There is a lot of games that you can play that will work for you, only game that won't work for you is no game.

**The Cost of Stasis**
Resisting growth isn't just staying where you are; it's actually degenerative. In life, you're either moving forward or falling behind.


**Testing the Introvert Hypothesis**
Even those who believe they need no social relationships benefit from at least minimal human connection.




**Peer Pressure in Context**
The common "would you jump off a cliff" argument misunderstands teenage social behavior as irrational rather than as essential in identity formation.



**Collective wisdom** 
The value of social feedback 

![[IMG_20250507_222851.jpg]]


**Emotional Taxonomy**
There are three categories of stimuli that elicit emotional responses: things that help progress, things that are obstacles, and things that are not yet understood



**The Hierarchy of Tasks**
Complex instructions need to be broken down into smaller steps that are appropriate for the individual's developmental level


**Finding the Starting Point**
Effective teaching requires discovering precisely what subroutines someone lacks, then building from that foundation rather than assuming prerequisites


**The integrated identity** 
Being good isn't just abstract idea; its combination of specific abilities working together in a structured way to achieve common goals.




**Meaning as Experience**
(Beyond Nihilistic Rationalism)
Meaning is an experienced reality where your skills, actions, and purpose are aligned toward your highest goals, guided by your conscience and interests.

**Willingness to accept sacrifice**
Genuine inquiry requires openness to receiving uncomfortable answers that might require sacrificing cherished beliefs or behaviours.




**The Death of Self-Parts**
(Necessary Transformation)
Meaningful personal change requires allowing certain aspects of yourself to die, not just small fragments but sometimes whole limbs of your identity.



Stupid things that I do:
1) try to help people with things they are perfectly capable to do themselves 
2) try to help, teach, preach people things they don't want 
3) try to share with people around me philosophy and Psychological concepts that they don't care about 
4) even when I can see people showing me disinterest, I try to share these ideas and concepts that I find fascinating 
5) failing to practically understand that my mouth is not for most of those ears. And if I may walk this path, must I walk it with my mistress solitary. If not then I will be walking it with loneliness.




**Genetic temperament influence** 
Predisposition VS Determinism 


**The inevitable balance** 
Every temperament has both strengths and weaknesses, with traits that offers advantages also bringing specific vulnerabilities.

**The Blind Spot of Self-Righteousness**
Individuals who are most certain they would resist totalitarian influence are often the most vulnerable to compliance because they fail to acknowledge the darker aspects of their own nature

You have to play that out, saying there is a hell I will never visit a d you have to make it real , you have to take it personally.



# 05_Faith in tragedy 


**Nature of Tragedy**
Tragedy occurs when terrible things happen unjustly, reaching its ultimate form when the worst possible happens to the least deserving.


**The harrowing of hell**
Beyond facing tragedy, humans must confront the reality of malevolence, which can be even more devastating than death itself.


People develop ptsd , not because something unspeakably evil happened to them. Bu they did something terrible to others.
People can bear awful lot of unjust suffering, but if they are betrayed by someone malevolent and if it's themselves, they take long time to recover maybe they never recover.


**Childhood Trauma**

**Nazi Threats**
There is little evidence that Nazi Germany systematically punished civilians for failing to comply with its regime, instead it seems like most of their actions were voluntary.



That's one of the terrible things about participating in great acts of evil , is that you can be pulled into them by your virtues 
(like you joined the Nazi not because you want to kill, but because you are loyal to your comrades and can't leave them alone to shoulder that burden )



**Uncomfortable Reality**
(Compliance Is Common)
Many believe they would resist totalitarian ideologies, like Nazism, but history shows most conform, even when it leads to atrocities.

If you are really concerned about that such evil things happen, and you should be because they will happen again at any moment and you should take all the steps necessary to make sure you wouldn't be a participant.
And you need to understand that if it happens you probably would be a participant. And since that's the case you need to make some altercations to your character that's bloody damn Deep.



If you are more horrible than you think, and you probably are. Than you are more harder to contend with and not easily persuaded.



**Getting Satan Behind You**
Jung's shadow integration involves confronting your darker traits and transforming them into strength, making you formidable instead of controlled by negativity.

The part that may make itself manifest in form of vengefulness and resentment , if you can integrate that and use it as something like charismatic power of anger at your finger tips 
(just like bruce banner, when he says "that's my secret I am always angry" (and he says it in such calm and composed manner) and turns into hulk at his will)

You are not going to be dangerous till you know you can be, and once you know you can be dangerous then you can integrate that in part of yourself.
And now you are a formidable force instead of being just dangerous.


Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said, 
One mans who stops lying can bring down a totalitarian state.



**Individual Responsibility**
Living honestly in your own life can help prevent dishonesty in the world around you; taking personal responsibility affirms human dignity.



If you start speaking the truth a little too late in a totalitarian state, probably the tyrants will kill you.
But maybe it's better to risk death, then to live in hell.



**Proper Sacrifice**
(Commitment to Excellence)
Proper sacrifice means giving your all to an enterprise, knowing that success is proportionate to commitment rather than half-hearted efforts.



**Therapy's Painful Truth**
(Retracing Wrong Turns)
Therapeutic work often means unwinding life's vicious turns to find the origin point-usually an inappropriate decision one knew was wrong.



You think and devlop a vision of just how dismal your life could be, doing all the stupid things you are doing, and what would happen if you do it better. And that's useful and you do it to the point that , when the situation arises you have the situation played out in your head in a realistic manner and you would decide maybe you don't want to go down that path.


**Positive and negative future** 
Heaven and hell
**==You must develop a vision of hell and heaven for your life.==**


**Flawed as you are, you still might be worthy!**
Despite tragedy of life you may have intrinsic merit.


**Resilience** 
Maintaining self-worth 


In life you may be punished because of the wrong things you did,
And sometimes you might be punished despite of your innocence.


**Faith in Existence**
(Self-Worth Amid Suffering)
Job's story demonstrates the struggle of maintaining belief in one's intrinsic value despite hardship, external judgment, and the temptation to lose self-worth and faith in life itself.



Despite the fact all unjust misery is dumped upon me, I am not going to draw nihilistic and cynical conclusion that life is meaningless and evil.



Some people are selfish and pathological narcissistic, self centred.
But most people don't have compassion for themselves.


**Compassion for Yourself**
Many struggle to value themselves as much as others, often giving others the benefit of the doubt while withholding it from themselves, despite deserving the same compassion.


Think about yourself as someone you care for, look at your self as someone you care for the most. 



**Foundation of society** 
Presumption of cooperation 
(Like saying I'll assume that we can walk uphill together, until you show me otherwise)
This is the courageous Way.

Don't be naive or cynical with people, be courageous with them.


**Courage vs. Cynicism**
(Psychological Strategy)
Courage acknowledges human darkness while choosing cooperation for mutual benefit, avoiding both naive trust and cynical distrust of others.

This is important to make sure you don't write an apriori assumption about an individual.


**Religious practice** 
(Courageous trust)
Adopting the attitude of courageous trust, loving thy neighbour, even loving thy enemy.
It's courageous because you know the  person is potentially full of snakes and dangerous.



**Workplace Psychopaths**
(Manipulation Tactics)
Sophisticated workplace psychopaths weaponize your past mistakes, exaggerating them as evidence of incompetence while stealing valuable assets.



**Developing a Life Vision**
Giving yourself the benefit of the doubt is essential to developing a proper vision for your life.



**The Core of Meaning**
(Justifying Life's Struggle)
Meaning emerges when something of sufficient value justifies the suffering and malevolence encountered in life, making the struggle worthwhile.



**Love as Justification**
Love affirms that despite life's catastrophes, a person's existence has intrinsic worth. This is why we grieve when people leave us.



**Friendship and Literature**
Amid hardship, a friend's support and an appreciation for the literary arts provided a crucial escape and the strength to persevere.



**Sources of Meaning**
Our interests, duties, responsibilities, and relationships form recognizable patterns that buoy us through periods of extreme suffering.
