Infinity is just a calculation that human mind cannot comprehend.
And some infinity are bigger than other.

For eg: the infinity between 0 and 2 is bigger than infinity between 0 and 1.

In an investigation assumptions kill

Don't worry about what went wrong, focus on putting it right 

Never get distracted form the exact job at hand,
Go back to every detail you know, work the clues that you have.

Do it once, do it right.


Never to make any single little assumption in an investigation.

"Stoicism? A philosophy for those who’ve already given up. It’s a surrender dressed as virtue, teaching you to numb yourself to life’s chaos instead of embracing it. They call it 'rationality,' but it’s just fear of passion, of power. You’re not living if you’re not willing to suffer, to desire, to risk everything. Stoics are half-dead, clinging to their little fortress of 'control.' Pathetic."
