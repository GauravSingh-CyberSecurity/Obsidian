**The Modern** 
==WHAT IS THE MODERN?==
Below is the accounts and recollection's on beginning of modern.


1500 MARKED A SIGNIFICANT TURNING POINT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, HERALDING THE DAWN OF THE MODERN ERA WITH ITS PROFOUND INTELLECTUAL SHIFTS AND GROUNDBREAKING IDEAS.


**CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS**
THE GENOESE EXPLORER IS RENOWNED FOR HIS PIVOTAL ROLE IN INITIATING EUROPEAN EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION OF THE AMERICAS IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY.


THE GUTENBERG BIBLE, PRINTED BY JOHANNES GUTENBERG IN THE 15TH CENTURY, REPRESENTS A MONUMENTAL LEAP IN HUMAN COMMUNICATION.



**Michelangelo's** 
("DAVID")
"EVERY BLOCK OF STONE HAS A STATUE INSIDE IT AND IT IS THE TASK OF THE SCULPTOR TO DISCOVER IT."
 -Michelangelo



**ON THE FABRIC of the HUMAN BODY**
 -ANDREAS VESALIUS



**NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI**
("THE PRINCE")
"IT IS BETTER TO BE FEARED THAN LOVED, IF YOU CANNOT BE BOTH."


People starting to reject the Greeco-Roman and Judeo-Cristian philosophy, dogmas and Axiom. And starting to re-analyse the world by asking again questions from the most basic Axioms, eg:- 
DOES THE SUN REVOLVE AROUND THE EARTH, OR DOES THE EARTH REVOLVE AROUND THE SUN?



**THE REFORMATION**

Now, let's see :

WHAT CAN WE LEARN OR GOT FROM THE GREEKS? Or from Christians?

**GRECO-ROMAN CIVILIZATION**
1. NATURALIZATION
2. REASON
3. SCIENCE
4. SELF-CONFIDENCE
5. ACHIEVEMENT

**JUDEO-CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION**
1. SUPERNATURALISM
2. FAITH
3. DOGMA
4. HELPLESSNESS
5. RENUNCIATION

****MARTIN LUTHER (1517)** 
He Said:

"ARISTOTLE IS TRULY A DEVIL, A HORRID CALUMNIATOR, A WICKED SYCOPHANT, A PRINCE OF DARKNESS, A BEAST, A MOST HORRID IMPOSTER ON MANKIND,"

"ONE IN WHOM THERE IS SCARCELY ANY PHILOSOPHY, A PUBLIC AND PROFESSED LIAR, A GOAT, AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE LOCUSTS, CATERPILLARS, FROGS, AND LICE."
 -MARTIN LUTHER

Basically I don't agree with Martin Luther, but we will have him here to have some opposing views in our account while studying older philosophy origin and studying modern philosophy.

**Francis Bacon writings:-**

"BEING CONVINCED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT MAKES ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES" 

"ALL TRIAL SHOULD BE MADE, WHETHER THAT COMMERCE BETWEEN THE MIND OF MAN AND THE NATURE OF THINGS"


"WHICH IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN ANYTHING ON EARTH, OR AT LEAST THAN ANYTHING THAT IS OF THE EARTH"


"MIGHT BY ANY MEANS BE RESTORED TO ITS PERFECT AND ORIGINAL CONDITION, OR IF THAT MAY NOT BE, YET REDUCED TO A BETTER CONDITION THAN THAT IN WHICH IT NOW IS."


"NOW THAT THE ERRORS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED"


"THE ENTIRE FABRIC OF HUMAN REASON WHICH WE EMPLOY IN THE INQUISITION OF NATURE IS BADLY PUT TOGETHER AND BUILT UP, AND LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION."


"THE ENTIRE FABRIC OF HUMAN REASON WHICH WE EMPLOY IN THE INQUISITION OF NATURE IS BADLY PUT TOGETHER AND BUILT UP, AND LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION."


"THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE LEFT, THEREFORE TO TRY THE WHOLE THING ANEW UPON A BETTER PLAN"

"AND TO COMMENCE A TOTAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SCIENCES, ARTS, AND ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, RAISED UPON THE PROPER FOUNDATIONS."

"AND THIS, THOUGH IN THE PROJECT AND UNDERTAKING IT MAY SEEM A THING INFINITE AND BEYOND ALL THE POWERS OF MAN, YET WHEN IT COMES TO BE DEALT WITH IT WILL BE FOUND SOUND AND SOBER"

"FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE IN TAKING ORDER FOR THE COLLECTING AND PERFECTING OF A NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HISTORY"

"UNENCUMBERED WITH LITERATURE AND BOOK-LEARNING"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES MAY NO LONGER FLOAT IN AIR, BUT REST ON THE SOLID FOUNDATION OF EXPERIENCE OF EVERY KIND"

"THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE IS NOT PROSPEROUS NOR GREATLY ADVANCING"

"A WAY MUST BE OPENED FOR THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY HITHERTO KNOWN"

"IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MEN DO NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTAND EITHER THEIR STORE OR THEIR STRENGTH"

"BUT OVERRATE THE ONE AND UNDERRATE THE OTHER."

"THE EXCESS OF HONOR AND ADMIRATION WITH WHICH OUR EXISTING STOCK OF INVENTIONS IS REGARDED"

"FOR LET A MAN LOOK CAREFULLY INTO ALL THAT VARIETY OF BOOKS WITH WHICH THE ARTS AND SCIENCES ABOUND, HE WILL FIND EVERYWHERE ENDLESS REPETITIONS OF THE SAME THING."
