**The Modern** 
==WHAT IS THE MODERN?==
Below is the accounts and recollection's on beginning of modern.


1500 MARKED A SIGNIFICANT TURNING POINT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, HERALDING THE DAWN OF THE MODERN ERA WITH ITS PROFOUND INTELLECTUAL SHIFTS AND GROUNDBREAKING IDEAS.


**CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS**
THE GENOESE EXPLORER IS RENOWNED FOR HIS PIVOTAL ROLE IN INITIATING EUROPEAN EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION OF THE AMERICAS IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY.


THE GUTENBERG BIBLE, PRINTED BY JOHANNES GUTENBERG IN THE 15TH CENTURY, REPRESENTS A MONUMENTAL LEAP IN HUMAN COMMUNICATION.



**Michelangelo's** 
("DAVID")
"EVERY BLOCK OF STONE HAS A STATUE INSIDE IT AND IT IS THE TASK OF THE SCULPTOR TO DISCOVER IT."
 -Michelangelo



**ON THE FABRIC of the HUMAN BODY**
 -ANDREAS VESALIUS



**NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI**
("THE PRINCE")
"IT IS BETTER TO BE FEARED THAN LOVED, IF YOU CANNOT BE BOTH."


People starting to reject the Greeco-Roman and Judeo-Cristian philosophy, dogmas and Axiom. And starting to re-analyse the world by asking again questions from the most basic Axioms, eg:- 
DOES THE SUN REVOLVE AROUND THE EARTH, OR DOES THE EARTH REVOLVE AROUND THE SUN?



**THE REFORMATION**
(1517)


**MARTIN LUTHER**
(1517)
THE 95 THESES for REFORM


**RAPHAEL**
(1483-1520)
THE SCHOOL of ATHENS

Now, let's see :

WHAT CAN WE LEARN OR GOT FROM THE GREEKS? Or from Christians?

**GRECO-ROMAN CIVILIZATION**
1. NATURALIZATION
2. REASON
3. SCIENCE
4. SELF-CONFIDENCE
5. ACHIEVEMENT

**JUDEO-CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION**
1. SUPERNATURALISM
2. FAITH
3. DOGMA
4. HELPLESSNESS
5. RENUNCIATION


---

**MARTIN LUTHER (1517)** 
He Said:

"ARISTOTLE IS TRULY A DEVIL, A HORRID CALUMNIATOR, A WICKED SYCOPHANT, A PRINCE OF DARKNESS, A BEAST, A MOST HORRID IMPOSTER ON MANKIND,"

"ONE IN WHOM THERE IS SCARCELY ANY PHILOSOPHY, A PUBLIC AND PROFESSED LIAR, A GOAT, AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE LOCUSTS, CATERPILLARS, FROGS, AND LICE."
 -MARTIN LUTHER

Basically I don't agree with Martin Luther, but we will have him here to have some opposing views in our account while studying older philosophy origin and studying modern philosophy.

## Francis Bacon writings:-

"BEING CONVINCED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT MAKES ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES" 

"ALL TRIAL SHOULD BE MADE, WHETHER THAT COMMERCE BETWEEN THE MIND OF MAN AND THE NATURE OF THINGS"


"WHICH IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN ANYTHING ON EARTH, OR AT LEAST THAN ANYTHING THAT IS OF THE EARTH"


"MIGHT BY ANY MEANS BE RESTORED TO ITS PERFECT AND ORIGINAL CONDITION, OR IF THAT MAY NOT BE, YET REDUCED TO A BETTER CONDITION THAN THAT IN WHICH IT NOW IS."


"NOW THAT THE ERRORS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED"


"THE ENTIRE FABRIC OF HUMAN REASON WHICH WE EMPLOY IN THE INQUISITION OF NATURE IS BADLY PUT TOGETHER AND BUILT UP, AND LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION."


"THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE LEFT, THEREFORE TO TRY THE WHOLE THING ANEW UPON A BETTER PLAN"

"AND TO COMMENCE A TOTAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SCIENCES, ARTS, AND ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, RAISED UPON THE PROPER FOUNDATIONS."

"AND THIS, THOUGH IN THE PROJECT AND UNDERTAKING IT MAY SEEM A THING INFINITE AND BEYOND ALL THE POWERS OF MAN, YET WHEN IT COMES TO BE DEALT WITH IT WILL BE FOUND SOUND AND SOBER"

"FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE IN TAKING ORDER FOR THE COLLECTING AND PERFECTING OF A NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HISTORY"

"UNENCUMBERED WITH LITERATURE AND BOOK-LEARNING"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES MAY NO LONGER FLOAT IN AIR, BUT REST ON THE SOLID FOUNDATION OF EXPERIENCE OF EVERY KIND"

"THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE IS NOT PROSPEROUS NOR GREATLY ADVANCING"

"A WAY MUST BE OPENED FOR THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY HITHERTO KNOWN"

"IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MEN DO NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTAND EITHER THEIR STORE OR THEIR STRENGTH"

"BUT OVERRATE THE ONE AND UNDERRATE THE OTHER."

"THE EXCESS OF HONOR AND ADMIRATION WITH WHICH OUR EXISTING STOCK OF INVENTIONS IS REGARDED"

"FOR LET A MAN LOOK CAREFULLY INTO ALL THAT VARIETY OF BOOKS WITH WHICH THE ARTS AND SCIENCES ABOUND, HE WILL FIND EVERYWHERE ENDLESS REPETITIONS OF THE SAME THING."

"FOR ITS VALUE AND UTILITY IT MUST BE PLAINLY AVOWED THAT THAT WISDOM WHICH WE HAVE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM THE GREEKS"

"IS BUT LIKE THE BOYHOOD OF KNOWLEDGE, AND HAS THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTY OF BOYS: IT CAN TALK, BUT IT CANNOT GENERATE, FOR IT IS FRUITFUL OF CONTROVERSIES BUT BARREN OF WORKS."

"WE DO NOT FIND IT SO; THEY, ON THE CONTRARY, AS HAVING IN THEM SOME BREATH OF LIFE, ARE CONTINUALLY GROWING AND BECOMING MORE PERFECT."

"AS ORIGINALLY INVENTED THEY ARE COMMONLY RUDE, CLUMSY, AND SHAPELESS; AFTERWARDS THEY ACQUIRE NEW POWERS AND MORE COMMODIOUS ARRANGEMENTS AND CONSTRUCTIONS"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE INTELLECTUAL SCIENCES, ON THE CONTRARY, STAND LIKE STATUES, WORSHIPPED AND CELEBRATED, BUT NOT MOVED OR ADVANCED."

"NAY, THEY SOMETIMES FLOURISH MOST IN THE HANDS OF THE FIRST AUTHOR, AND AFTERWARDS DEGENERATE."

"FOR WHEN MEN HAVE ONCE MADE OVER THEIR JUDGMENTS TO OTHERS' KEEPING"

"AND LET IT NOT BE SAID THAT THE SCIENCES HAVE BEEN GROWING GRADUALLY TILL THEY HAVE AT LAST REACHED THEIR FULL STATURE"

"AND IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY WHO, NOT BINDING THEMSELVES EITHER TO OTHER MEN'S OPINIONS OR TO THEIR OWN, BUT LOVING LIBERTY"

"THERE IS NONE WHO HAS DWELT UPON EXPERIENCE AND THE FACTS OF NATURE AS LONG AS IS NECESSARY."

"AS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THE FIRST PLACE TO LOGIC, SUPPOSING THAT THE SUREST HELPS TO THE SCIENCES WERE TO BE FOUND IN THAT,"

"THEY HAVE INDEED MOST TRULY AND EXCELLENTLY PERCEIVED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT LEFT TO ITS OWN COURSE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED"

"OUR STEPS MUST BE GUIDED BY A CLUE, AND THE WHOLE WAY FROM THE VERY FIRST PERCEPTION OF THE SENSES MUST BE LAID OUT UPON A SURE PLAN."

"BUT, AS IN FORMER AGES, WHEN MEN SAILED ONLY BY OBSERVATION OF THE STARS,"

"THEY COULD INDEED COAST ALONG THE SHORES OF THE OLD CONTINENT OR CROSS A FEW SMALL AND MEDITERRANEAN SEAS"

"BUT BEFORE THE OCEAN COULD BE TRAVERSED AND THE NEW WORLD DISCOVERED, THE USE OF THE MARINER'S NEEDLE, AS A MORE FAITHFUL AND CERTAIN GUIDE, HAD TO BE FOUND OUT"

"BUT BEFORE WE CAN REACH THE REMOTER AND MORE HIDDEN PARTS OF NATURE, IT IS NECESSARY THAT A MORE PERFECT USE AND APPLICATION OF THE HUMAN MIND AND INTELLECT BE INTRODUCED."

"THOSE WHO BEFORE ME HAVE APPLIED THEMSELVES TO THE INVENTION OF ARTS HAVE BUT CAST A GLANCE OR TWO UPON FACTS AND EXAMPLES"

"ON THE CONTRARY, DWELLING PURELY AND CONSTANTLY AMONG THE FACTS OF NATURE"

"WITHDRAW MY INTELLECT FROM THEM NO FURTHER THAN MAY SUFFICE TO LET THE IMAGES AND RAYS OF NATURAL OBJECTS MEET IN A POINT, AS THEY DO IN THE SENSE OF VISION"

"FOR I DO NOT ENDEAVOR EITHER BY TRIUMPHS OF CONFUTATION"

"OR PLEADINGS OF ANTIQUITY, OR ASSUMPTION OF AUTHORITY"

"OR EVEN BY THE VEIL OF OBSCURITY"




"I LEAD THEM TO THINGS THEMSELVES AND THE CONCORDANCES OF THINGS, THAT THEY MAY SEE FOR THEMSELVES... WHAT THEY CAN DISPUTE"

"IN ANYTHING I HAVE BEEN EITHER TOO CREDULOUS OR TOO LITTLE AWAKE AND ATTENTIVE,"

"OR IF I HAVE FALLEN OFF BY THE WAY AND LEFT THE INQUIRY INCOMPLETE, NEVERTHELESS I SO PRESENT THESE THINGS NAKED AND OPEN, THAT MY ERRORS CAN BE MARKED"

"I HAVE ESTABLISHED FOREVER A TRUE AND LAWFUL MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE EMPIRICAL AND THE RATIONAL FACULTY"

"THE UNKIND AND ILL-STARRED DIVORCE AND SEPARATION OF WHICH HAS THROWN INTO CONFUSION ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HUMAN FAMILY."

"I WOULD ADDRESS ONE GENERAL ADMONITION TO ALL THAT THEY CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE TRUE ENDS OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THAT THEY SEEK IT NOT EITHER FOR PLEASURE OF THE MIND"

"OR FOR CONTENTION, OR FOR SUPERIORITY TO OTHERS, OR FOR PROFIT, OR FAME, OR POWER, OR ANY OF THESE INFERIOR THINGS, BUT FOR THE BENEFIT AND USE OF LIFE"

# (KNOWLEDGE IS FOR THE BENEFIT AND USE OF LIFE)



"HAVING THUS COASTED PAST THE ANCIENT ARTS, THE NEXT POINT IS TO EQUIP THE INTELLECT FOR PASSING BEYOND."

"THE ART WHICH I INTRODUCE WITH THIS VIEW... IS A KIND OF LOGIC, THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND THE ORDINARY LOGIC IS GREAT, INDEED, IMMENSE."

"VIZ., IN THE END AIMED AT, IN THE ORDER OF DEMONSTRATION, AND IN THE STARTING POINT"

"FOR IN THE ORDINARY LOGIC ALMOST ALL THE WORK IS SPENT ABOUT THE SYLLOGISM."



INDUCTION IS A METHOD OF REASONING DERIVED FROM SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS TO FORM GENERAL CONCLUSIONS OR PRINCIPLES.

"THE LOGICIANS SEEM HARDLY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT, BUT THEY PASS IT BY WITHA SLIGHT NOTICE"

"NOW IF THE VERY NOTIONS OF THE MIND BE IMPROPERLY AND OVERHASTILY ABSTRACTED FROM FACTS,"

"VAGUE, NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEFINITE, FAULTY IN SHORT, IN MANY WAYS, THE WHOLE EDIFICE TUMBLES."

"YET IN DEALING WITH THE NATURE OF THINGS I USE INDUCTION THROUGHOUT... HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ORDER OF DEMONSTRATION IS LIKEWISE INVERTED."

"NOW MY PLAN IS TO PROCEED REGULARLY AND GRADUALLY FROM ONE AXIOM TO ANOTHER, SO THAT THE MOST GENERAL ARE NOT REACHED TILL THE LAST"

"BUT THE GREATEST CHANGE I INTRODUCE IS IN THE FORM ITSELF OF INDUCTION AND THE JUDGMENT MADE THEREBY."

"FOR THE INDUCTION OF WHICH THE LOGICIANS SPEAK, WHICH PROCEEDS BY SIMPLE ENUMERATION, IS A PUERILE THING"

"THE INFORMATION OF THE SENSE ITSELF I SIFT AND EXAMINE IN MANY WAYS. FOR CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE SENSES DECEIVE; BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME THEY SUPPLY THE MEANS OF DISCOVERING THEIR OWN ERRORS"

"THEY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT OF THEMSELVES IF THE HUMAN INTELLECT WERE EVEN AND LIKE A FAIR SHEET OF PAPER WITH NO WRITING ON IT."

"SINCE THE MINDS OF MEN ARE STRANGELY POSSESSED AND BESET SO THAT THERE IS NO TRUE AND EVEN SURFACE LEFT TO REFLECT THE GENUINE RAYS OF THINGS, IT IS NECESSARY TO SEEK A REMEDY FOR THIS ALSO."

There is an I , and as long as that I is thinking ; it exists.

# MEDITATION I (by Rene Descartes )

OF THE THINGS OF WHICH WE MAY DOUBT

"SEVERAL YEARS HAVE NOW ELAPSED SINCE I FIRST BECAME AWARE THAT I HAD ACCEPTED, EVEN FROM MY YOUTH, MANY FALSE OPINIONS FOR TRUE"

"AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY WHAT I AFTERWARD BASED ON SUCH PRINCIPLES WAS HIGHLY DOUBTFUL"

"AND FROM THAT TIME I WAS CONVINCED OF THE NECESSITY OF UNDERTAKING ONCE IN MY LIFE TO RID MYSELF OF ALL THE OPINIONS I HAD ADOPTED,"

"AND OF COMMENCING ANEW THE WORK OF BUILDING FROM THE FOUNDATION, IF I DESIRED TO ESTABLISH A FIRM AND ABIDING SUPERSTRUCTURE IN THE SCIENCES."

"TO-DAY, THEN, SINCE I HAVE OPPORTUNELY FREED MY MIND FROM ALL CARES AND AM HAPPILY DISTURBED BY NO PASSIONS,"

"I WILL AT LENGTH APPLY MYSELF EARNESTLY AND FREELY TO THE GENERAL OVERTHROW OF ALL MY FORMER OPINIONS."

"ALL THAT I HAVE, UP TO THIS MOMENT, ACCEPTED AS POSSESSED OF THE HIGHEST TRUTH AND CERTAINTY, I RECEIVED EITHER FROM OR THROUGH THE SENSES."

"I OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THAT THESE SOMETIMES MISLED US"

"AND IT IS THE PART OF PRUDENCE NOT TO PLACE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THAT BY WHICH WE HAVE EVEN ONCE BEEN DECEIVED."

"BUT HOW COULD I DENY THAT I POSSESS THESE HANDS AND THIS BODY, AND WITHAL ESCAPE BEING CLASSED WITH PERSONS IN A STATE OF INSANITY"

"THOUGH THIS BE TRUE, I MUST NEVERTHELESS HERE CONSIDER THAT I AM A MAN, AND THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, I AM IN THE HABIT OF SLEEPING, AND REPRESENTING TO MYSELF"

"IN DREAMS THOSE SAME THINGS, OR EVEN SOMETIMES OTHERS LESS PROBABLE, WHICH THE INSANE THINK ARE PRESENTED TO THEM IN THEIR WAKING MOMENTS."

"AT THE PRESENT MOMENT, HOWEVER, I CERTAINLY LOOK UPON THIS PAPER WITH EYES WIDE AWAKE; THE HEAD WHICH I NOW MOVE IS NOT ASLEEP;"

"I EXTEND THIS HAND CONSCIOUSLY AND WITH EXPRESS PURPOSE, AND I PERCEIVE IT; THE OCCURRENCES IN SLEEP ARE NOT SO DISTINCT AS ALL THIS."

"I FEEL GREATLY ASTONISHED; AND IN AMAZEMENT I ALMOST PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I AM NOW DREAMING."

"ARITHMETIC, GEOMETRY, AND THE OTHER SCIENCES OF THE SAME CLASS,... CONTAIN SOMEWHAT THAT IS CERTAIN AND INDUBITABLE:"

"FOR WHETHER I AM AWAKE OR ASLEEP, TWO PLUS THREE MAKES FIVE, AND A SQUARE HAS ONLY FOUR SIDES."

"NEVERTHELESS, THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS A GOD WHO IS ALL POWERFUL, AND WHO CREATED ME, SUCH AS I AM,"

"HAS, FOR A LONG TIME, OBTAINED STEADY POSSESSION OF MY MIND."

"HOW DO I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALSO DECEIVED EACH TIME I ADD TOGETHER TWO AND THREE, OR NUMBER THE SIDES OF A SQUARE, OR FORM SOME JUDGMENT STILL MORE SIMPLE, IF MORE SIMPLE INDEED CAN BE IMAGINED?"

"BUT PERHAPS DEITY HAS NOT BEEN WILLING THAT I SHOULD BE THUS DECEIVED, FOR HE IS SAID TO BE SUPREMELY GOOD. IF, HOWEVER, IT WERE REPUGNANT TO THE GOODNESS OF DEITY TO HAVE CREATED ME SUBJECT TO CONSTANT DECEPTION"

"TO THESE REASONINGS I HAVE ASSUREDLY NOTHING TO REPLY"

"TO THESE REASONINGS I HAVE ASSUREDLY NOTHING TO REPLY, BUT AM CONSTRAINED AT LAST TO AVOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OF ALL THAT I FORMERLY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT"

OF THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN MIND; AND THAT IT IS MORE EASILY KNOWN THAN THE BODY

"THAT IT IS NO LONGER IN MY POWER TO FORGET THEM. NOR DO Ι SEE, MEANWHILE, ANY PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THEY CAN BE RESOLVED"

"I WILL, NEVERTHELESS, MAKE AN EFFORT, AND TRY ANEW"

"ARCHIMEDES, THAT HE MIGHT TRANSPORT THE ENTIRE GLOBE FROM THE PLACE IT OCCUPIED TO ANOTHER, DEMANDED ONLY A POINT THAT WAS FIRM AND IMMOVABLE;"

"SO, ALSO, I SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENTERTAIN THE HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS, IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DISCOVER ONLY ONE THING THAT IS CERTAIN AND INDUBITABLE."

"I SUPPOSE, ACCORDINGLY, THAT ALL THE THINGS WHICH I SEE ARE FALSE (FICTITIOUS); I BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THOSE OBJECTS WHICH MY FALLACIOUS MEMORY REPRESENTS EVER EXISTED;"

"I SUPPOSE THAT I POSSESS NO SENSES; I BELIEVE THAT BODY, FIGURE, EXTENSION, MOTION, AND PLACE ARE MERELY FICTIONS OF MY MIND."

"WHAT IS THERE, THEN, THAT CAN BE ESTEEMED TRUE? PERHAPS THIS ONLY, THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CERTAIN."

"BUT WHY SUPPOSE SUCH A BEING, FOR IT MAY BE I MYSELF AM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THEM? AM I, THEN, AT LEAST NOT SOMETHING?"

"AM I SO DEPENDENT ON THE BODY AND THE SENSES THAT WITHOUT THESE I CANNOT EXIST?"

"SO THAT IT MUST, IN FINE, BE MAINTAINED, ALL THINGS BEING MATURELY AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED, THAT THIS PROPOSITION I AM, I EXIST,"

"IS NECESSARILY TRUE EACH TIME IT IS EXPRESSED BY ME, OR CONCEIVEDIN MY MIND."

## MEDITATION III OF GOD: THAT HE EXISTS (by Rene Descartes )

EMPIRICISM: THE PHILOSOPHICAL

THEORY THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS DERIVED FROM SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION.

MODERN PHILOSOPHY FOCUSES ON KNOWLEDGE, EXISTENCE, MORALITY, AND HUMAN NATURE, EMPHASIZING REASON, SCIENCE, AND INDIVIDUALISM.

HOW CAN I PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD KNOWING ONLY THAT I EXIST AND ALL OF THE REST IS DOUBTFUL?

"I WILL NOW CLOSE MY EYES, I WILL STOP MY EARS, I WILL TURN AWAY MY SENSES FROM THEIR OBJECTS,"

"I WILL EVEN EFFACE FROM MY CONSCIOUSNESS ALL THE IMAGES OF CORPOREAL THINGS;"

"I WILL USE CIRCUMSPECTION, AND CONSIDER WITH CARE WHETHER I CAN STILL DISCOVER IN MYSELF ANYTHING FURTHER WHICH I HAVE NOT YET HITHERTO OBSERVED."

"THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF A GOD PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY MIND, I AM CONSTRAINED TO ADMIT THAT IT IS EASY FOR HIM, IF HE WISHES IT,"

"TO CAUSE ME TO ERR, EVEN IN MATTERS WHERE I THINK I POSSESS THE HIGHEST EVIDENCE"

"THE IDEA BY WHICH I CONCEIVE A GOD SOVEREIGN, ETERNAL, INFINITE, IMMUTABLE, ALL-KNOWING, ALL-POWERFUL, AND THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF HIMSELF"

"NOW, IT IS MANIFEST BY THE NATURAL LIGHT THAT THERE MUST AT LEAST BE AS MUCH REALITY IN THE EFFICIENT AND TOTAL CAUSE AS IN ITS EFFECT;"

"FOR WHENCE CAN THE EFFECT DRAW ITS REALITY IF NOT FROM ITS CAUSE?"

"FOR WHENCE CAN THE EFFECT DRAW ITS REALITY IF NOT FROM ITS CAUSE?"

**WHERE DO WE GET THE NOTION OF GOD ON OUR OWN?**

"AND THE WHOLE FORCE OF THE ARGUMENT OF WHICH I HAVE HERE AVAILED MYSELF TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, CONSISTS IN THIS, THAT I PERCEIVE"

"I COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE OF SUCH A NATURE AS I AM, AND YET HAVE IN MY MIND THE IDEA OF A GOD, IF GOD DID NOT IN REALITY EXIST"

# MEDITATIONS ON FIRST PHILOSOPHY
(PUBLISHED 1641)

---

Now, after studying the works of Rene Descartes:

Here I challenge Descartes notion that God exists, he says because I am an imperfect being and so I cannot create a perfect being myself, in essence He is saying that if there exists something imperfect, that imperfect thing can not generate the perfect thing.
Eg:- a painting of Sunflower can not create the sunflower; the sunflower needs to exist for there to be an imperfect depiction of sunflower in form of the "painting of sunflower".
So it means that the perfect being god exists and he created me the imperfect being.

But I challenge this notion by saying, how do you define the perfect being all knowing all good, how do you say that is perfect?
What if I argue that multiple imperfect being existing in the space-time, created in the the notion of a perfect being by combining all the perfection from their own community and created a singularity that is a reflection of all the perfection or opposite of their imperfections.

For eg: they took the best physical body that ever existed in space-time that we could ever experience in existence, then they took the most intelligent mind, then they took all the known knowledge across the whole civilization, 
then they took the imperfections that are truly imperfections or maybe some of those they believe to be imperfections then they said the reverse of this is the part of perfection. 
And we accumulated all of this across civilization across the whole space-time of existence of us thinking beings and combined all of that what we consider perfection into one singularity and we called that a singularity a being. A singular being a God.

Because we know that first came the polyethic (multiple gods system) 
then followed the 
monolithic(single god system)

It is probably because first us humans created multiple symbols of perfection for every aspect of reality.

Eg: god of knowledge - a being with all the knowledge there is, 
god of power - a being with all the power there is, 
god of elements - a being that has control of all the elements there is.

Then later on we used all these multiple perfections (Gods); 
and combined all of them in a singularity again; 
hence creating a singular perfect being - The monolithic God.

Summary :-
→ Humans saw multiple aspects of reality, each with a spectrum from perfection to imperfection
→ For each aspect, they imagined the most perfect form and called it the god of that aspect
→ This led to a collection of perfect beings across all aspects (Polytheistic God system)
→ Eventually, they merged this pool of perfect beings into one singular, all-encompassing being (Monotheistic God system)



So even though Rene Descartes claim that he threw all that is known out and starts from zero, he says that in first inquiry of method of Doubt "I think therefore I am" , and establishes the first truth that "There is an I , and as long as that I is thinking ; it exists."

But after that very quickly he fails in trying establish the second truth on top of his first truth using his method of Doubt. He tries to prove that God exists as discussed above.

But for his attempt to prove that God exists, We can clearly see him using a lot of pre-supposition and axioms as he moves forward in his Questioning and method of Doubt.

PS: I accept the first deduction that Rene Descartes does using the "Method of Doubt "

A book by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre that explores existentialism, consciousness, and the nature of freedom.


"The essence of Dasein lies in its existence."
-**Martin Heidegger**


## EXISTENTIALISM IS A HUMANISM.                   (An Essay by Jean-Paul Sartre)


**EXISTENTIALISM**
A philosophical movement that explores the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

"My purpose here is to offer a defence of existentialism against several reproaches that have been laid against it. First, it has been reproached as an invitation to people to dwell in quietism of despair."

"From another quarter we are reproached for having underlined all that is ignominious in the human situation..."

"For since we ignore the commandments of God and all values prescribed as eternal, nothing remains but what is strictly voluntary. Everyone can do what he likes, and will be incapable, from such a point of view, of condemning either the point of view or the action of anyone else."


**DOGMATISM**
An expression of a belief or opinion as if it were a fact.
Often compared to stubbornness or narrow mindedness.

"What they have in common is simply the fact that they believe that existence comes before essence - or, if you will, that we must begin from the subjective."


The conception in the mind of the artisan, the paperknife maker, is the essence of what is to be a paperknife.


# ( Essence precedes existence. )
In essence, anything that exists, the essence of that thing was conceptualized before it came into existence.
Eg: A bulb, before even a bulb was created, it's essence was conceptualized by its creator. The creator first conceptualized that they want to bring in existence an electrical tool that can emit light, which must help humans to see at night. Then the engineering of the Bulb started and it was bought into existence.



"Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it...If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing."


"Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills, and as he conceives himself after already existing - as he wills to be after that leap towards existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself."

"Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism."

"Thus, the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders."

"And, when we say that man is responsible for himself, we do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for all men."

"Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of the individual subject and, on the other, that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity.

It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism. When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men."

"All the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be... Our responsibility is thus much greater than we had supposed, for it concerns mankind as a whole."

"When a man commits himself to anything, fully realising that he is not only choosing what he will be, but is thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind - in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility. There are many, indeed, who show no such anxiety. But we affirm that they are merely disguising their anguish or are in flight from it."


**ABRAHAM AND ISAAC**
The story of Abraham and Isaac appears in Genesis 22, where God tests Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, at Moriah.

In the Bible, Abraham is portrayed as a righteous man who is committed to God, compassionate, hospitable, and a man of peace. But In reality he is not righteous because he shifts responsibility of his actions on God and says God asked me to give the most unspeakable sacrifice, and he doesn't even question it. And How does he even know that the voice he heard is of God?


"And when we speak of "abandonment" - a favorite word of Heidegger - we only mean to say that God does not exist...There can no longer be any good a priori, since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it. It is nowhere written that 'the good' exists, that one must be honest or must not lie, since we are now upon the plane where there are only men. Dostoevsky once wrote: 'If God did not exist, everything would be permitted'..."


"...man is free, man is freedom. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. - We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free."

## THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS                         [A philosophical essay by Albert Camus ]
(published in 1942)

**SISYPHUS**
A figure from Greek mythology who is condemned for all eternity to roll a boulder up a mountain, only to watch it roll back down again as soon as he reaches the peak.


"The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor."

"This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. ...one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone...the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down..."

## "... he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock."


"If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious."

"The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd."

"If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy...There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth."

"All Sisyphus' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him... **==One must imagine Sisyphus happy.==** "


"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."

To ask ;
**Why Live? | Why not commit suicide?** Same thing.
They both are the same Question, but just with a shift in perspective!

**Why live?** : takes you towards creating your own meaning, purpose and commitment. It moves you towards taking the Fate you were given, and committing to that fate. Calling it "My fate"; "My carrer"; "My family" ; "My life"

**Why not commit suicide?** Takes you towards, nihilism, what is the meaning, saying the existence and life in itself is meaningless so everything that is, was and ever will be is all totally absurd. Because one day all will be dead and gone and forgotten.


Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were both leftists and existentialists.

==**Being willing to accept full responsibility for who you are , that is what an authentic human being will do.**==

But what most of the human beings do is want to shift that responsibility elsewhere, saying and even believing things like"God made me this way!" ; "society made me this way" ; I couldn't help it , my wrong doings are not because of me it's because so and so made me do it.

For **Exesitentialism** This is like it's first commandment: "you are responsible, and you step up to that responsibility or you don't "


How do you know the voice you think you hearing is the voice of God? And not of your own paranoid self or even the voices of bad spirits?

And then why should you not Questions these voices in your head , that are asking you to make the greatest sacrifices, why should you obey these voices if you do not know for sure it's the voice of God?

If I just obey without asking questions and not knowing the reason for the action I am doing or am supposed to do, I shift responsibility to someone else, "someone told me to do it, someone else made me do it"

But we are in that circumstances and we don't know what the right thing to do is, But we have to do something and we have to take full responsibility for it.

It is nowhere written that the good exists. Not in the mind of God, not in platonic forms, not built into the structure of nature. There is no True standards of Good and Bad.

So even if God exists or does not exists. Everything is permitted.

Even if God told you to do something, you still have choice to do it or not. And if he doesn't exists then there is no one to obey anyways.
So whatever you choose it's totally your responsibility and no one else's.
That is why:-
"...man is free, man is freedom. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. - We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that **man is condemned to be free**."


That is the wonderful , rhetorical , paradoxical Truth of human beings:
"We are free, and we cannot escape the fact that we are free." That is what it is to be a human being, a choosing being.
A pure potential that can go anywhere, and any attempts to escape that is an irresponsiblity, you have to accept it.

The absurdity of existence is there lies no inherent meaning to life. The meaning of life lies in what we give to it.
So you can't find purpose or meaning of life, you have to create it in life.

 You give life meaning by embracing the fate you’ve been given and making it your own. Meaning comes when you choose to commit—to say, “This is my fate, and I accept it,” “This is my family, and I stand by them,” or “This is not just a job, but my career, and I dedicate myself to it.” It’s a shift in perspective: instead of seeing life as an absurd, meaningless journey destined to fade into nothingness, you begin to see it as your own personal path. By willingly committing to what you must do in life and making it truly yours, you find purpose. In that commitment, you discover joy and fulfillment—not because the task changes, but because your perspective do.
 
**==You have to will yourself into joy.==**
