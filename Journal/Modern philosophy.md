**The Modern** 
==WHAT IS THE MODERN?==
Below is the accounts and recollection's on beginning of modern.


1500 MARKED A SIGNIFICANT TURNING POINT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, HERALDING THE DAWN OF THE MODERN ERA WITH ITS PROFOUND INTELLECTUAL SHIFTS AND GROUNDBREAKING IDEAS.


**CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS**
THE GENOESE EXPLORER IS RENOWNED FOR HIS PIVOTAL ROLE IN INITIATING EUROPEAN EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION OF THE AMERICAS IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY.


THE GUTENBERG BIBLE, PRINTED BY JOHANNES GUTENBERG IN THE 15TH CENTURY, REPRESENTS A MONUMENTAL LEAP IN HUMAN COMMUNICATION.



**Michelangelo's** 
("DAVID")
"EVERY BLOCK OF STONE HAS A STATUE INSIDE IT AND IT IS THE TASK OF THE SCULPTOR TO DISCOVER IT."
 -Michelangelo



**ON THE FABRIC of the HUMAN BODY**
 -ANDREAS VESALIUS



**NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI**
("THE PRINCE")
"IT IS BETTER TO BE FEARED THAN LOVED, IF YOU CANNOT BE BOTH."


People starting to reject the Greeco-Roman and Judeo-Cristian philosophy, dogmas and Axiom. And starting to re-analyse the world by asking again questions from the most basic Axioms, eg:- 
DOES THE SUN REVOLVE AROUND THE EARTH, OR DOES THE EARTH REVOLVE AROUND THE SUN?



**THE REFORMATION**
(1517)


**MARTIN LUTHER**
(1517)
THE 95 THESES for REFORM


**RAPHAEL**
(1483-1520)
THE SCHOOL of ATHENS

Now, let's see :

WHAT CAN WE LEARN OR GOT FROM THE GREEKS? Or from Christians?

**GRECO-ROMAN CIVILIZATION**
1. NATURALIZATION
2. REASON
3. SCIENCE
4. SELF-CONFIDENCE
5. ACHIEVEMENT

**JUDEO-CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION**
1. SUPERNATURALISM
2. FAITH
3. DOGMA
4. HELPLESSNESS
5. RENUNCIATION

**MARTIN LUTHER (1517)** 
He Said:

"ARISTOTLE IS TRULY A DEVIL, A HORRID CALUMNIATOR, A WICKED SYCOPHANT, A PRINCE OF DARKNESS, A BEAST, A MOST HORRID IMPOSTER ON MANKIND,"

"ONE IN WHOM THERE IS SCARCELY ANY PHILOSOPHY, A PUBLIC AND PROFESSED LIAR, A GOAT, AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE LOCUSTS, CATERPILLARS, FROGS, AND LICE."
 -MARTIN LUTHER

Basically I don't agree with Martin Luther, but we will have him here to have some opposing views in our account while studying older philosophy origin and studying modern philosophy.

**FRANCIS BACON**
(1561-1626)
THE FATHER of MODERN PHILOSOPHY

**FRANCIS BACON vs Rene Descartes** 
Both are the competitors in the claim of Father of modern philosophy .

**THE NEW ORGANON**
 -by Francis Bacon


**THE GREAT INSTAURATION**
(1620)
FRANCIS BACON'S THE GREAT INSTAURATION PROPOSES A REVOLUTIONARY METHOD FOR SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION.

**Francis Bacon writings:-**

"BEING CONVINCED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT MAKES ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES" 

"ALL TRIAL SHOULD BE MADE, WHETHER THAT COMMERCE BETWEEN THE MIND OF MAN AND THE NATURE OF THINGS"


"WHICH IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN ANYTHING ON EARTH, OR AT LEAST THAN ANYTHING THAT IS OF THE EARTH"


"MIGHT BY ANY MEANS BE RESTORED TO ITS PERFECT AND ORIGINAL CONDITION, OR IF THAT MAY NOT BE, YET REDUCED TO A BETTER CONDITION THAN THAT IN WHICH IT NOW IS."


"NOW THAT THE ERRORS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED"


"THE ENTIRE FABRIC OF HUMAN REASON WHICH WE EMPLOY IN THE INQUISITION OF NATURE IS BADLY PUT TOGETHER AND BUILT UP, AND LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION."


"THE ENTIRE FABRIC OF HUMAN REASON WHICH WE EMPLOY IN THE INQUISITION OF NATURE IS BADLY PUT TOGETHER AND BUILT UP, AND LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION."


"THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE LEFT, THEREFORE TO TRY THE WHOLE THING ANEW UPON A BETTER PLAN"

"AND TO COMMENCE A TOTAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SCIENCES, ARTS, AND ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, RAISED UPON THE PROPER FOUNDATIONS."

"AND THIS, THOUGH IN THE PROJECT AND UNDERTAKING IT MAY SEEM A THING INFINITE AND BEYOND ALL THE POWERS OF MAN, YET WHEN IT COMES TO BE DEALT WITH IT WILL BE FOUND SOUND AND SOBER"

"FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE IN TAKING ORDER FOR THE COLLECTING AND PERFECTING OF A NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HISTORY"

"UNENCUMBERED WITH LITERATURE AND BOOK-LEARNING"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES MAY NO LONGER FLOAT IN AIR, BUT REST ON THE SOLID FOUNDATION OF EXPERIENCE OF EVERY KIND"

"THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE IS NOT PROSPEROUS NOR GREATLY ADVANCING"

"A WAY MUST BE OPENED FOR THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY HITHERTO KNOWN"

"IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MEN DO NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTAND EITHER THEIR STORE OR THEIR STRENGTH"

"BUT OVERRATE THE ONE AND UNDERRATE THE OTHER."

"THE EXCESS OF HONOR AND ADMIRATION WITH WHICH OUR EXISTING STOCK OF INVENTIONS IS REGARDED"

"FOR LET A MAN LOOK CAREFULLY INTO ALL THAT VARIETY OF BOOKS WITH WHICH THE ARTS AND SCIENCES ABOUND, HE WILL FIND EVERYWHERE ENDLESS REPETITIONS OF THE SAME THING."

"FOR ITS VALUE AND UTILITY IT MUST BE PLAINLY AVOWED THAT THAT WISDOM WHICH WE HAVE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM THE GREEKS"

"IS BUT LIKE THE BOYHOOD OF KNOWLEDGE, AND HAS THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTY OF BOYS: IT CAN TALK, BUT IT CANNOT GENERATE, FOR IT IS FRUITFUL OF CONTROVERSIES BUT BARREN OF WORKS."

"WE DO NOT FIND IT SO; THEY, ON THE CONTRARY, AS HAVING IN THEM SOME BREATH OF LIFE, ARE CONTINUALLY GROWING AND BECOMING MORE PERFECT."

"AS ORIGINALLY INVENTED THEY ARE COMMONLY RUDE, CLUMSY, AND SHAPELESS; AFTERWARDS THEY ACQUIRE NEW POWERS AND MORE COMMODIOUS ARRANGEMENTS AND CONSTRUCTIONS"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE INTELLECTUAL SCIENCES, ON THE CONTRARY, STAND LIKE STATUES, WORSHIPPED AND CELEBRATED, BUT NOT MOVED OR ADVANCED."

"NAY, THEY SOMETIMES FLOURISH MOST IN THE HANDS OF THE FIRST AUTHOR, AND AFTERWARDS DEGENERATE."

"FOR WHEN MEN HAVE ONCE MADE OVER THEIR JUDGMENTS TO OTHERS' KEEPING"

"AND LET IT NOT BE SAID THAT THE SCIENCES HAVE BEEN GROWING GRADUALLY TILL THEY HAVE AT LAST REACHED THEIR FULL STATURE"

"AND IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY WHO, NOT BINDING THEMSELVES EITHER TO OTHER MEN'S OPINIONS OR TO THEIR OWN, BUT LOVING LIBERTY"

"THERE IS NONE WHO HAS DWELT UPON EXPERIENCE AND THE FACTS OF NATURE AS LONG AS IS NECESSARY."

"AS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THE FIRST PLACE TO LOGIC, SUPPOSING THAT THE SUREST HELPS TO THE SCIENCES WERE TO BE FOUND IN THAT,"

"THEY HAVE INDEED MOST TRULY AND EXCELLENTLY PERCEIVED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT LEFT TO ITS OWN COURSE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED"

"OUR STEPS MUST BE GUIDED BY A CLUE, AND THE WHOLE WAY FROM THE VERY FIRST PERCEPTION OF THE SENSES MUST BE LAID OUT UPON A SURE PLAN."

"BUT, AS IN FORMER AGES, WHEN MEN SAILED ONLY BY OBSERVATION OF THE STARS,"

"THEY COULD INDEED COAST ALONG THE SHORES OF THE OLD CONTINENT OR CROSS A FEW SMALL AND MEDITERRANEAN SEAS"

"BUT BEFORE THE OCEAN COULD BE TRAVERSED AND THE NEW WORLD DISCOVERED, THE USE OF THE MARINER'S NEEDLE, AS A MORE FAITHFUL AND CERTAIN GUIDE, HAD TO BE FOUND OUT"

"BUT BEFORE WE CAN REACH THE REMOTER AND MORE HIDDEN PARTS OF NATURE, IT IS NECESSARY THAT A MORE PERFECT USE AND APPLICATION OF THE HUMAN MIND AND INTELLECT BE INTRODUCED."

"THOSE WHO BEFORE ME HAVE APPLIED THEMSELVES TO THE INVENTION OF ARTS HAVE BUT CAST A GLANCE OR TWO UPON FACTS AND EXAMPLES"

"ON THE CONTRARY, DWELLING PURELY AND CONSTANTLY AMONG THE FACTS OF NATURE"

"WITHDRAW MY INTELLECT FROM THEM NO FURTHER THAN MAY SUFFICE TO LET THE IMAGES AND RAYS OF NATURAL OBJECTS MEET IN A POINT, AS THEY DO IN THE SENSE OF VISION"

"FOR I DO NOT ENDEAVOR EITHER BY TRIUMPHS OF CONFUTATION"

"OR PLEADINGS OF ANTIQUITY, OR ASSUMPTION OF AUTHORITY"

"OR EVEN BY THE VEIL OF OBSCURITY"




"I LEAD THEM TO THINGS THEMSELVES AND THE CONCORDANCES OF THINGS, THAT THEY MAY SEE FOR THEMSELVES... WHAT THEY CAN DISPUTE"

"IN ANYTHING I HAVE BEEN EITHER TOO CREDULOUS OR TOO LITTLE AWAKE AND ATTENTIVE,"

"OR IF I HAVE FALLEN OFF BY THE WAY AND LEFT THE INQUIRY INCOMPLETE, NEVERTHELESS I SO PRESENT THESE THINGS NAKED AND OPEN, THAT MY ERRORS CAN BE MARKED"

"I HAVE ESTABLISHED FOREVER A TRUE AND LAWFUL MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE EMPIRICAL AND THE RATIONAL FACULTY"

"THE UNKIND AND ILL-STARRED DIVORCE AND SEPARATION OF WHICH HAS THROWN INTO CONFUSION ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HUMAN FAMILY."

"I WOULD ADDRESS ONE GENERAL ADMONITION TO ALL THAT THEY CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE TRUE ENDS OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THAT THEY SEEK IT NOT EITHER FOR PLEASURE OF THE MIND"

"OR FOR CONTENTION, OR FOR SUPERIORITY TO OTHERS, OR FOR PROFIT, OR FAME, OR POWER, OR ANY OF THESE INFERIOR THINGS, BUT FOR THE BENEFIT AND USE OF LIFE"

# (KNOWLEDGE IS FOR THE BENEFIT AND USE OF LIFE)



"HAVING THUS COASTED PAST THE ANCIENT ARTS, THE NEXT POINT IS TO EQUIP THE INTELLECT FOR PASSING BEYOND."

"THE ART WHICH I INTRODUCE WITH THIS VIEW... IS A KIND OF LOGIC, THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND THE ORDINARY LOGIC IS GREAT, INDEED, IMMENSE."

"VIZ., IN THE END AIMED AT, IN THE ORDER OF DEMONSTRATION, AND IN THE STARTING POINT"

"FOR IN THE ORDINARY LOGIC ALMOST ALL THE WORK IS SPENT ABOUT THE SYLLOGISM."



INDUCTION IS A METHOD OF REASONING DERIVED FROM SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS TO FORM GENERAL CONCLUSIONS OR PRINCIPLES.

"THE LOGICIANS SEEM HARDLY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT, BUT THEY PASS IT BY WITHA SLIGHT NOTICE"

"NOW IF THE VERY NOTIONS OF THE MIND BE IMPROPERLY AND OVERHASTILY ABSTRACTED FROM FACTS,"

"VAGUE, NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEFINITE, FAULTY IN SHORT, IN MANY WAYS, THE WHOLE EDIFICE TUMBLES."

"YET IN DEALING WITH THE NATURE OF THINGS I USE INDUCTION THROUGHOUT... HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ORDER OF DEMONSTRATION IS LIKEWISE INVERTED."

"NOW MY PLAN IS TO PROCEED REGULARLY AND GRADUALLY FROM ONE AXIOM TO ANOTHER, SO THAT THE MOST GENERAL ARE NOT REACHED TILL THE LAST"

"BUT THE GREATEST CHANGE I INTRODUCE IS IN THE FORM ITSELF OF INDUCTION AND THE JUDGMENT MADE THEREBY."

"FOR THE INDUCTION OF WHICH THE LOGICIANS SPEAK, WHICH PROCEEDS BY SIMPLE ENUMERATION, IS A PUERILE THING"

"THE INFORMATION OF THE SENSE ITSELF I SIFT AND EXAMINE IN MANY WAYS. FOR CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE SENSES DECEIVE; BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME THEY SUPPLY THE MEANS OF DISCOVERING THEIR OWN ERRORS"

"THEY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT OF THEMSELVES IF THE HUMAN INTELLECT WERE EVEN AND LIKE A FAIR SHEET OF PAPER WITH NO WRITING ON IT."

"SINCE THE MINDS OF MEN ARE STRANGELY POSSESSED AND BESET SO THAT THERE IS NO TRUE AND EVEN SURFACE LEFT TO REFLECT THE GENUINE RAYS OF THINGS, IT IS NECESSARY TO SEEK A REMEDY FOR THIS ALSO."
