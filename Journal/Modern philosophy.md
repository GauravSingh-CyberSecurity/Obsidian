**The Modern** 
==WHAT IS THE MODERN?==
Below is the accounts and recollection's on beginning of modern.


1500 MARKED A SIGNIFICANT TURNING POINT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, HERALDING THE DAWN OF THE MODERN ERA WITH ITS PROFOUND INTELLECTUAL SHIFTS AND GROUNDBREAKING IDEAS.


**CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS**
THE GENOESE EXPLORER IS RENOWNED FOR HIS PIVOTAL ROLE IN INITIATING EUROPEAN EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION OF THE AMERICAS IN THE LATE 15TH CENTURY.


THE GUTENBERG BIBLE, PRINTED BY JOHANNES GUTENBERG IN THE 15TH CENTURY, REPRESENTS A MONUMENTAL LEAP IN HUMAN COMMUNICATION.



**Michelangelo's** 
("DAVID")
"EVERY BLOCK OF STONE HAS A STATUE INSIDE IT AND IT IS THE TASK OF THE SCULPTOR TO DISCOVER IT."
 -Michelangelo



**ON THE FABRIC of the HUMAN BODY**
 -ANDREAS VESALIUS



**NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI**
("THE PRINCE")
"IT IS BETTER TO BE FEARED THAN LOVED, IF YOU CANNOT BE BOTH."


People starting to reject the Greeco-Roman and Judeo-Cristian philosophy, dogmas and Axiom. And starting to re-analyse the world by asking again questions from the most basic Axioms, eg:- 
DOES THE SUN REVOLVE AROUND THE EARTH, OR DOES THE EARTH REVOLVE AROUND THE SUN?



**THE REFORMATION**
(1517)


**MARTIN LUTHER**
(1517)
THE 95 THESES for REFORM


**RAPHAEL**
(1483-1520)
THE SCHOOL of ATHENS

---


Now, let's see :

WHAT CAN WE LEARN OR GOT FROM THE GREEKS? Or from Christians?

**GRECO-ROMAN CIVILIZATION**
1. NATURALIZATION
2. REASON
3. SCIENCE
4. SELF-CONFIDENCE
5. ACHIEVEMENT

**JUDEO-CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION**
1. SUPERNATURALISM
2. FAITH
3. DOGMA
4. HELPLESSNESS
5. RENUNCIATION


---

**MARTIN LUTHER (1517)** 
He Said:

"ARISTOTLE IS TRULY A DEVIL, A HORRID CALUMNIATOR, A WICKED SYCOPHANT, A PRINCE OF DARKNESS, A BEAST, A MOST HORRID IMPOSTER ON MANKIND,"

"ONE IN WHOM THERE IS SCARCELY ANY PHILOSOPHY, A PUBLIC AND PROFESSED LIAR, A GOAT, AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE LOCUSTS, CATERPILLARS, FROGS, AND LICE."
 -MARTIN LUTHER

Basically I don't agree with Martin Luther, but we will have him here to have some opposing views in our account while studying older philosophy origin and studying modern philosophy.

**THE GREAT INSTAURATION**
(1620)
FRANCIS BACON'S THE GREAT INSTAURATION PROPOSES A REVOLUTIONARY METHOD FOR SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION.

## Francis Bacon writings:-

"BEING CONVINCED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT MAKES ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES" 

"ALL TRIAL SHOULD BE MADE, WHETHER THAT COMMERCE BETWEEN THE MIND OF MAN AND THE NATURE OF THINGS"


"WHICH IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN ANYTHING ON EARTH, OR AT LEAST THAN ANYTHING THAT IS OF THE EARTH"


"MIGHT BY ANY MEANS BE RESTORED TO ITS PERFECT AND ORIGINAL CONDITION, OR IF THAT MAY NOT BE, YET REDUCED TO A BETTER CONDITION THAN THAT IN WHICH IT NOW IS."


"NOW THAT THE ERRORS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED"


"THE ENTIRE FABRIC OF HUMAN REASON WHICH WE EMPLOY IN THE INQUISITION OF NATURE IS BADLY PUT TOGETHER AND BUILT UP, AND LIKE SOME MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION."


"THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE LEFT, THEREFORE TO TRY THE WHOLE THING ANEW UPON A BETTER PLAN"

"AND TO COMMENCE A TOTAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SCIENCES, ARTS, AND ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE, RAISED UPON THE PROPER FOUNDATIONS."

"AND THIS, THOUGH IN THE PROJECT AND UNDERTAKING IT MAY SEEM A THING INFINITE AND BEYOND ALL THE POWERS OF MAN, YET WHEN IT COMES TO BE DEALT WITH IT WILL BE FOUND SOUND AND SOBER"

"FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE IN TAKING ORDER FOR THE COLLECTING AND PERFECTING OF A NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HISTORY"

"UNENCUMBERED WITH LITERATURE AND BOOK-LEARNING"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES MAY NO LONGER FLOAT IN AIR, BUT REST ON THE SOLID FOUNDATION OF EXPERIENCE OF EVERY KIND"

"THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE IS NOT PROSPEROUS NOR GREATLY ADVANCING"

"A WAY MUST BE OPENED FOR THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY HITHERTO KNOWN"

"IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MEN DO NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTAND EITHER THEIR STORE OR THEIR STRENGTH"

"BUT OVERRATE THE ONE AND UNDERRATE THE OTHER."

"THE EXCESS OF HONOR AND ADMIRATION WITH WHICH OUR EXISTING STOCK OF INVENTIONS IS REGARDED"

"FOR LET A MAN LOOK CAREFULLY INTO ALL THAT VARIETY OF BOOKS WITH WHICH THE ARTS AND SCIENCES ABOUND, HE WILL FIND EVERYWHERE ENDLESS REPETITIONS OF THE SAME THING."

"FOR ITS VALUE AND UTILITY IT MUST BE PLAINLY AVOWED THAT THAT WISDOM WHICH WE HAVE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM THE GREEKS"

"IS BUT LIKE THE BOYHOOD OF KNOWLEDGE, AND HAS THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTY OF BOYS: IT CAN TALK, BUT IT CANNOT GENERATE, FOR IT IS FRUITFUL OF CONTROVERSIES BUT BARREN OF WORKS."

"WE DO NOT FIND IT SO; THEY, ON THE CONTRARY, AS HAVING IN THEM SOME BREATH OF LIFE, ARE CONTINUALLY GROWING AND BECOMING MORE PERFECT."

"AS ORIGINALLY INVENTED THEY ARE COMMONLY RUDE, CLUMSY, AND SHAPELESS; AFTERWARDS THEY ACQUIRE NEW POWERS AND MORE COMMODIOUS ARRANGEMENTS AND CONSTRUCTIONS"

"PHILOSOPHY AND THE INTELLECTUAL SCIENCES, ON THE CONTRARY, STAND LIKE STATUES, WORSHIPPED AND CELEBRATED, BUT NOT MOVED OR ADVANCED."

"NAY, THEY SOMETIMES FLOURISH MOST IN THE HANDS OF THE FIRST AUTHOR, AND AFTERWARDS DEGENERATE."

"FOR WHEN MEN HAVE ONCE MADE OVER THEIR JUDGMENTS TO OTHERS' KEEPING"

"AND LET IT NOT BE SAID THAT THE SCIENCES HAVE BEEN GROWING GRADUALLY TILL THEY HAVE AT LAST REACHED THEIR FULL STATURE"

"AND IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY WHO, NOT BINDING THEMSELVES EITHER TO OTHER MEN'S OPINIONS OR TO THEIR OWN, BUT LOVING LIBERTY"

"THERE IS NONE WHO HAS DWELT UPON EXPERIENCE AND THE FACTS OF NATURE AS LONG AS IS NECESSARY."

"AS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THE FIRST PLACE TO LOGIC, SUPPOSING THAT THE SUREST HELPS TO THE SCIENCES WERE TO BE FOUND IN THAT,"

"THEY HAVE INDEED MOST TRULY AND EXCELLENTLY PERCEIVED THAT THE HUMAN INTELLECT LEFT TO ITS OWN COURSE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED"

"OUR STEPS MUST BE GUIDED BY A CLUE, AND THE WHOLE WAY FROM THE VERY FIRST PERCEPTION OF THE SENSES MUST BE LAID OUT UPON A SURE PLAN."

"BUT, AS IN FORMER AGES, WHEN MEN SAILED ONLY BY OBSERVATION OF THE STARS,"

"THEY COULD INDEED COAST ALONG THE SHORES OF THE OLD CONTINENT OR CROSS A FEW SMALL AND MEDITERRANEAN SEAS"

"BUT BEFORE THE OCEAN COULD BE TRAVERSED AND THE NEW WORLD DISCOVERED, THE USE OF THE MARINER'S NEEDLE, AS A MORE FAITHFUL AND CERTAIN GUIDE, HAD TO BE FOUND OUT"

"BUT BEFORE WE CAN REACH THE REMOTER AND MORE HIDDEN PARTS OF NATURE, IT IS NECESSARY THAT A MORE PERFECT USE AND APPLICATION OF THE HUMAN MIND AND INTELLECT BE INTRODUCED."

"THOSE WHO BEFORE ME HAVE APPLIED THEMSELVES TO THE INVENTION OF ARTS HAVE BUT CAST A GLANCE OR TWO UPON FACTS AND EXAMPLES"

"ON THE CONTRARY, DWELLING PURELY AND CONSTANTLY AMONG THE FACTS OF NATURE"

"WITHDRAW MY INTELLECT FROM THEM NO FURTHER THAN MAY SUFFICE TO LET THE IMAGES AND RAYS OF NATURAL OBJECTS MEET IN A POINT, AS THEY DO IN THE SENSE OF VISION"

"FOR I DO NOT ENDEAVOR EITHER BY TRIUMPHS OF CONFUTATION"

"OR PLEADINGS OF ANTIQUITY, OR ASSUMPTION OF AUTHORITY"

"OR EVEN BY THE VEIL OF OBSCURITY"




"I LEAD THEM TO THINGS THEMSELVES AND THE CONCORDANCES OF THINGS, THAT THEY MAY SEE FOR THEMSELVES... WHAT THEY CAN DISPUTE"

"IN ANYTHING I HAVE BEEN EITHER TOO CREDULOUS OR TOO LITTLE AWAKE AND ATTENTIVE,"

"OR IF I HAVE FALLEN OFF BY THE WAY AND LEFT THE INQUIRY INCOMPLETE, NEVERTHELESS I SO PRESENT THESE THINGS NAKED AND OPEN, THAT MY ERRORS CAN BE MARKED"

"I HAVE ESTABLISHED FOREVER A TRUE AND LAWFUL MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE EMPIRICAL AND THE RATIONAL FACULTY"

"THE UNKIND AND ILL-STARRED DIVORCE AND SEPARATION OF WHICH HAS THROWN INTO CONFUSION ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HUMAN FAMILY."

"I WOULD ADDRESS ONE GENERAL ADMONITION TO ALL THAT THEY CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE TRUE ENDS OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THAT THEY SEEK IT NOT EITHER FOR PLEASURE OF THE MIND"

"OR FOR CONTENTION, OR FOR SUPERIORITY TO OTHERS, OR FOR PROFIT, OR FAME, OR POWER, OR ANY OF THESE INFERIOR THINGS, BUT FOR THE BENEFIT AND USE OF LIFE"

# (KNOWLEDGE IS FOR THE BENEFIT AND USE OF LIFE)



"HAVING THUS COASTED PAST THE ANCIENT ARTS, THE NEXT POINT IS TO EQUIP THE INTELLECT FOR PASSING BEYOND."

"THE ART WHICH I INTRODUCE WITH THIS VIEW... IS A KIND OF LOGIC, THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND THE ORDINARY LOGIC IS GREAT, INDEED, IMMENSE."

"VIZ., IN THE END AIMED AT, IN THE ORDER OF DEMONSTRATION, AND IN THE STARTING POINT"

"FOR IN THE ORDINARY LOGIC ALMOST ALL THE WORK IS SPENT ABOUT THE SYLLOGISM."



INDUCTION IS A METHOD OF REASONING DERIVED FROM SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS TO FORM GENERAL CONCLUSIONS OR PRINCIPLES.

"THE LOGICIANS SEEM HARDLY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT, BUT THEY PASS IT BY WITHA SLIGHT NOTICE"

"NOW IF THE VERY NOTIONS OF THE MIND BE IMPROPERLY AND OVERHASTILY ABSTRACTED FROM FACTS,"

"VAGUE, NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEFINITE, FAULTY IN SHORT, IN MANY WAYS, THE WHOLE EDIFICE TUMBLES."

"YET IN DEALING WITH THE NATURE OF THINGS I USE INDUCTION THROUGHOUT... HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ORDER OF DEMONSTRATION IS LIKEWISE INVERTED."

"NOW MY PLAN IS TO PROCEED REGULARLY AND GRADUALLY FROM ONE AXIOM TO ANOTHER, SO THAT THE MOST GENERAL ARE NOT REACHED TILL THE LAST"

"BUT THE GREATEST CHANGE I INTRODUCE IS IN THE FORM ITSELF OF INDUCTION AND THE JUDGMENT MADE THEREBY."

"FOR THE INDUCTION OF WHICH THE LOGICIANS SPEAK, WHICH PROCEEDS BY SIMPLE ENUMERATION, IS A PUERILE THING"

"THE INFORMATION OF THE SENSE ITSELF I SIFT AND EXAMINE IN MANY WAYS. FOR CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE SENSES DECEIVE; BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME THEY SUPPLY THE MEANS OF DISCOVERING THEIR OWN ERRORS"

"THEY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT OF THEMSELVES IF THE HUMAN INTELLECT WERE EVEN AND LIKE A FAIR SHEET OF PAPER WITH NO WRITING ON IT."

"SINCE THE MINDS OF MEN ARE STRANGELY POSSESSED AND BESET SO THAT THERE IS NO TRUE AND EVEN SURFACE LEFT TO REFLECT THE GENUINE RAYS OF THINGS, IT IS NECESSARY TO SEEK A REMEDY FOR THIS ALSO."

# MEDITATION I (by Rene Descartes )

OF THE THINGS OF WHICH WE MAY DOUBT

"SEVERAL YEARS HAVE NOW ELAPSED SINCE I FIRST BECAME AWARE THAT I HAD ACCEPTED, EVEN FROM MY YOUTH, MANY FALSE OPINIONS FOR TRUE"

"AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY WHAT I AFTERWARD BASED ON SUCH PRINCIPLES WAS HIGHLY DOUBTFUL"

"AND FROM THAT TIME I WAS CONVINCED OF THE NECESSITY OF UNDERTAKING ONCE IN MY LIFE TO RID MYSELF OF ALL THE OPINIONS I HAD ADOPTED,"

"AND OF COMMENCING ANEW THE WORK OF BUILDING FROM THE FOUNDATION, IF I DESIRED TO ESTABLISH A FIRM AND ABIDING SUPERSTRUCTURE IN THE SCIENCES."

"TO-DAY, THEN, SINCE I HAVE OPPORTUNELY FREED MY MIND FROM ALL CARES AND AM HAPPILY DISTURBED BY NO PASSIONS,"

"I WILL AT LENGTH APPLY MYSELF EARNESTLY AND FREELY TO THE GENERAL OVERTHROW OF ALL MY FORMER OPINIONS."

"ALL THAT I HAVE, UP TO THIS MOMENT, ACCEPTED AS POSSESSED OF THE HIGHEST TRUTH AND CERTAINTY, I RECEIVED EITHER FROM OR THROUGH THE SENSES."

"I OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THAT THESE SOMETIMES MISLED US"

"AND IT IS THE PART OF PRUDENCE NOT TO PLACE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THAT BY WHICH WE HAVE EVEN ONCE BEEN DECEIVED."

"BUT HOW COULD I DENY THAT I POSSESS THESE HANDS AND THIS BODY, AND WITHAL ESCAPE BEING CLASSED WITH PERSONS IN A STATE OF INSANITY"

"THOUGH THIS BE TRUE, I MUST NEVERTHELESS HERE CONSIDER THAT I AM A MAN, AND THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, I AM IN THE HABIT OF SLEEPING, AND REPRESENTING TO MYSELF"

"IN DREAMS THOSE SAME THINGS, OR EVEN SOMETIMES OTHERS LESS PROBABLE, WHICH THE INSANE THINK ARE PRESENTED TO THEM IN THEIR WAKING MOMENTS."

"AT THE PRESENT MOMENT, HOWEVER, I CERTAINLY LOOK UPON THIS PAPER WITH EYES WIDE AWAKE; THE HEAD WHICH I NOW MOVE IS NOT ASLEEP;"

"I EXTEND THIS HAND CONSCIOUSLY AND WITH EXPRESS PURPOSE, AND I PERCEIVE IT; THE OCCURRENCES IN SLEEP ARE NOT SO DISTINCT AS ALL THIS."

"I FEEL GREATLY ASTONISHED; AND IN AMAZEMENT I ALMOST PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I AM NOW DREAMING."

"ARITHMETIC, GEOMETRY, AND THE OTHER SCIENCES OF THE SAME CLASS,... CONTAIN SOMEWHAT THAT IS CERTAIN AND INDUBITABLE:"

"FOR WHETHER I AM AWAKE OR ASLEEP, TWO PLUS THREE MAKES FIVE, AND A SQUARE HAS ONLY FOUR SIDES."

"NEVERTHELESS, THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS A GOD WHO IS ALL POWERFUL, AND WHO CREATED ME, SUCH AS I AM,"

"HAS, FOR A LONG TIME, OBTAINED STEADY POSSESSION OF MY MIND."

"HOW DO I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALSO DECEIVED EACH TIME I ADD TOGETHER TWO AND THREE, OR NUMBER THE SIDES OF A SQUARE, OR FORM SOME JUDGMENT STILL MORE SIMPLE, IF MORE SIMPLE INDEED CAN BE IMAGINED?"

"BUT PERHAPS DEITY HAS NOT BEEN WILLING THAT I SHOULD BE THUS DECEIVED, FOR HE IS SAID TO BE SUPREMELY GOOD. IF, HOWEVER, IT WERE REPUGNANT TO THE GOODNESS OF DEITY TO HAVE CREATED ME SUBJECT TO CONSTANT DECEPTION"

"TO THESE REASONINGS I HAVE ASSUREDLY NOTHING TO REPLY"

"TO THESE REASONINGS I HAVE ASSUREDLY NOTHING TO REPLY, BUT AM CONSTRAINED AT LAST TO AVOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OF ALL THAT I FORMERLY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT"

OF THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN MIND; AND THAT IT IS MORE EASILY KNOWN THAN THE BODY

"THAT IT IS NO LONGER IN MY POWER TO FORGET THEM. NOR DO Ι SEE, MEANWHILE, ANY PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THEY CAN BE RESOLVED"

"I WILL, NEVERTHELESS, MAKE AN EFFORT, AND TRY ANEW"

"ARCHIMEDES, THAT HE MIGHT TRANSPORT THE ENTIRE GLOBE FROM THE PLACE IT OCCUPIED TO ANOTHER, DEMANDED ONLY A POINT THAT WAS FIRM AND IMMOVABLE;"

"SO, ALSO, I SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENTERTAIN THE HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS, IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DISCOVER ONLY ONE THING THAT IS CERTAIN AND INDUBITABLE."

"I SUPPOSE, ACCORDINGLY, THAT ALL THE THINGS WHICH I SEE ARE FALSE (FICTITIOUS); I BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THOSE OBJECTS WHICH MY FALLACIOUS MEMORY REPRESENTS EVER EXISTED;"

"I SUPPOSE THAT I POSSESS NO SENSES; I BELIEVE THAT BODY, FIGURE, EXTENSION, MOTION, AND PLACE ARE MERELY FICTIONS OF MY MIND."

"WHAT IS THERE, THEN, THAT CAN BE ESTEEMED TRUE? PERHAPS THIS ONLY, THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CERTAIN."

"BUT WHY SUPPOSE SUCH A BEING, FOR IT MAY BE I MYSELF AM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THEM? AM I, THEN, AT LEAST NOT SOMETHING?"

"AM I SO DEPENDENT ON THE BODY AND THE SENSES THAT WITHOUT THESE I CANNOT EXIST?"

"SO THAT IT MUST, IN FINE, BE MAINTAINED, ALL THINGS BEING MATURELY AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED, THAT THIS PROPOSITION I AM, I EXIST,"

"IS NECESSARILY TRUE EACH TIME IT IS EXPRESSED BY ME, OR CONCEIVEDIN MY MIND."

## MEDITATION III OF GOD: THAT HE EXISTS (by Rene Descartes )

EMPIRICISM: THE PHILOSOPHICAL

THEORY THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS DERIVED FROM SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION.

MODERN PHILOSOPHY FOCUSES ON KNOWLEDGE, EXISTENCE, MORALITY, AND HUMAN NATURE, EMPHASIZING REASON, SCIENCE, AND INDIVIDUALISM.

HOW CAN I PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD KNOWING ONLY THAT I EXIST AND ALL OF THE REST IS DOUBTFUL?

"I WILL NOW CLOSE MY EYES, I WILL STOP MY EARS, I WILL TURN AWAY MY SENSES FROM THEIR OBJECTS,"

"I WILL EVEN EFFACE FROM MY CONSCIOUSNESS ALL THE IMAGES OF CORPOREAL THINGS;"

"I WILL USE CIRCUMSPECTION, AND CONSIDER WITH CARE WHETHER I CAN STILL DISCOVER IN MYSELF ANYTHING FURTHER WHICH I HAVE NOT YET HITHERTO OBSERVED."

"THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF A GOD PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY MIND, I AM CONSTRAINED TO ADMIT THAT IT IS EASY FOR HIM, IF HE WISHES IT,"

"TO CAUSE ME TO ERR, EVEN IN MATTERS WHERE I THINK I POSSESS THE HIGHEST EVIDENCE"

"THE IDEA BY WHICH I CONCEIVE A GOD SOVEREIGN, ETERNAL, INFINITE, IMMUTABLE, ALL-KNOWING, ALL-POWERFUL, AND THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF HIMSELF"

"NOW, IT IS MANIFEST BY THE NATURAL LIGHT THAT THERE MUST AT LEAST BE AS MUCH REALITY IN THE EFFICIENT AND TOTAL CAUSE AS IN ITS EFFECT;"

"FOR WHENCE CAN THE EFFECT DRAW ITS REALITY IF NOT FROM ITS CAUSE?"

"FOR WHENCE CAN THE EFFECT DRAW ITS REALITY IF NOT FROM ITS CAUSE?"

**WHERE DO WE GET THE NOTION OF GOD ON OUR OWN?**

"AND THE WHOLE FORCE OF THE ARGUMENT OF WHICH I HAVE HERE AVAILED MYSELF TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, CONSISTS IN THIS, THAT I PERCEIVE"

"I COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE OF SUCH A NATURE AS I AM, AND YET HAVE IN MY MIND THE IDEA OF A GOD, IF GOD DID NOT IN REALITY EXIST"

# MEDITATIONS ON FIRST PHILOSOPHY
(PUBLISHED 1641)

---

Now, after studying the works of Rene Descartes:

Here I challenge Descartes notion that God exists, he says because I am an imperfect being and so I cannot create a perfect being myself, in essence He is saying that if there exists something imperfect, that imperfect thing can not generate the perfect thing.
Eg:- a painting of Sunflower can not create the sunflower; the sunflower needs to exist for there to be an imperfect depiction of sunflower in form of the "painting of sunflower".
So it means that the perfect being god exists and he created me the imperfect being.

But I challenge this notion by saying, how do you define the perfect being all knowing all good, how do you say that is perfect?
What if I argue that multiple imperfect being existing in the space-time, created in the the notion of a perfect being by combining all the perfection from their own community and created a singularity that is a reflection of all the perfection or opposite of their imperfections.

For eg: they took the best physical body that ever existed in space-time that we could ever experience in existence, then they took the most intelligent mind, then they took all the known knowledge across the whole civilization, 
then they took the imperfections that are truly imperfections or maybe some of those they believe to be imperfections then they said the reverse of this is the part of perfection. 
And we accumulated all of this across civilization across the whole space-time of existence of us thinking beings and combined all of that what we consider perfection into one singularity and we called that a singularity a being. A singular being a God.

Because we know that first came the polyethic (multiple gods system) 
then followed the 
monolithic(single god system)

It is probably because first us humans created multiple symbols of perfection for every aspect of reality.

Eg: god of knowledge - a being with all the knowledge there is, 
god of power - a being with all the power there is, 
god of elements - a being that has control of all the elements there is.

Then later on we used all these multiple perfections (Gods); 
and combined all of them in a singularity again; 
hence creating a singular perfect being - The monolithic God.

Summary :-
→ Humans saw multiple aspects of reality, each with a spectrum from perfection to imperfection
→ For each aspect, they imagined the most perfect form and called it the god of that aspect
→ This led to a collection of perfect beings across all aspects (Polytheistic God system)
→ Eventually, they merged this pool of perfect beings into one singular, all-encompassing being (Monotheistic God system)



So even though Rene Descartes claim that he threw all that is known out and starts from zero, he says that in first inquiry of method of Doubt "I think therefore I am" , and establishes the first truth that "There is an I , and as long as that I is thinking ; it exists."

But after that very quickly he fails in trying establish the second truth on top of his first truth using his method of Doubt. He tries to prove that God exists as discussed above.

But for his attempt to prove that God exists, We can clearly see him using a lot of pre-supposition and axioms as he moves forward in his Questioning and method of Doubt.

PS: I accept the first deduction that Rene Descartes does using the "Method of Doubt "

After working on the mathematical aspects of gravity and physics and after all the calculations and invention of calculus after he described all of the forces and some of the implications for that , when asked this metaphysical question "what is this fundamental thing gravity", and Newton was happy to say "I don't know".
And 
==for an intellectual to say "I don't know", and to say that confidently and as a methodological point of pride,== 
==Is a sign of modern==.

He said :-
"BUT HITHERTO I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER THE CAUSE OF THOSE PROPERTIES OF GRAVITY FROM PHENOMENA, AND I FRAME NO HYPOTHESIS; FOR WHATEVER IS NOT DEDUCED FROM THE PHENOΜΕΝΑ"
"IS TO BE CALLED AN HYPOTHESIS; AND HYPOTHESES, WHETHER METAPHYSICAL OR PHYSICAL, WHETHER OF OCCULT QUALITIES OR MECHANICAL, HAVE NO PLACE IN EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY."

**HUMAN UNDERSTANDING**

WHAT HE BELIEVES ONLY, AND TAKES UPON TRUST, ARE BUT SHREDS."

"GIVE TO CERTAIN SYSTEMS OF CREATED SENSELESS MATTER, PUT TOGETHER AS HE THINKS FIT, SOME DEGREES OF SENSE, PERCEPTION, AND THOUGHT"

***A Letter*** 
**Concerning TOLERATION**
 -by john locke

"I ESTEEM THAT TOLERATION TO BE THE CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC MARK OF THE TRUE CHURCH."
-JOHN LOCKE


"IF HE BE DESTITUTE OF CHARITY, MEEKNESS, AND GOOD-WILL IN GENERAL TOWARDS ALL MANKIND, EVEN TO THOSE THAT ARE NOT CHRISTIANS, HE IS CERTAINLY YET SHORT OF BEING A TRUE CHRISTIAN HIMSELF."
-JOHN LOCKE

"WHOSOEVER WILL LIST HIMSELF UNDER THE BANNER OF CHRIST, MUST, IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ABOVE ALL THINGS, MAKE WAR UPON HIS OWN LUSTS AND VICES."
-JOHN LOCKE

"I APPEAL TO THE CONSCIENCES OF THOSE THAT PERSECUTE, TORMENT, DESTROY, AND KILL OTHER MEN UPON PRETENCE OF RELIGION"

**WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT?**



"CIVIL INTERESTS I CALL LIFE, LIBERTY, HEALTH, AND INDOLENCY OF BODY; AND THE POSSESSION OF OUTWARD THINGS, SUCH AS MONEY, LANDS, HOUSES, FURNITURE, AND THE LIKE."
-JOHN LOCKE


"IT IS THE DUTY OF THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, BY THE IMPARTIAL EXECUTION OF EQUAL LAWS"
-JOHN LOCKE


"TO SECURE UNTO ALL THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND TO EVERY ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS IN PARTICULAR THE JUST POSSESSION OF THESE THINGS BELONGING TO THIS LIFE.”
-JOHN LOCKE


"THE WHOLE JURISDICTION OF THE MAGISTRATE REACHES ONLY TO THESE CIVIL CONCERNMENTS, AND THAT ALL CIVIL POWER, RIGHT AND DOMINION, IS BOUNDED AND CONFINED TO THE ONLY CARE OF PROMOTING THESE THINGS;"
-JOHN LOCKE


"AND THAT IT NEITHER CAN NOR OUGHT IN ANY MANNER TO BE EXTENDED TO THE SALVATION OF SOULS"
-JOHN LOCKE

"FIRST, BECAUSE THE CARE OF SOULS IS NOT COMMITTED TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, ANY MORE THAN TO OTHER ΜΕΝ."
-JOHN LOCKE

"BECAUSE IT APPEARS NOT THAT GOD HAS EVER GIVEN ANY SUCH AUTHORITY TO ONE MAN OVER ANOTHER"
-JOHN LOCKE

"NOR CAN ANY SUCH POWER BE VESTED IN THE MAGISTRATE BY THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE NO MAN CAN SO FAR ABANDON THE CARE OF HIS OWN SALVATION AS BLINDLY TO LEAVE TO THE CHOICE OF ANY OTHER"
-JOHN LOCKE

"ALL THE LIFE AND POWER OF TRUE RELIGION CONSIST IN THE INWARD AND FULL PERSUASION OF THE MIND; AND FAITH IS NOT FAITH WITHOUT BELIEVING."
-JOHN LOCKE

"IN THE SECOND PLACE, THE CARE OF SOULS CANNOT BELONG TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, BECAUSE HIS POWER CONSISTS ONLY IN OUTWARD FORCE"
-JOHN LOCKE

"BUT PENALTIES ARE NO WAY CAPABLE TO PRODUCE SUCH BELIEF. IT IS ONLY LIGHT AND EVIDENCE THAT CAN WORK A CHANGE
IN MEN'S OPINIONS"
-JOHN LOCKE

"IN THE THIRD PLACE, THE CARE OF THE SALVATION OF MEN'S SOULS CANNOT BELONG TO THE MAGISTRATE; BECAUSE, THOUGH THE RIGOUR OF LAWS AND THE FORCE OF PENALTIES WERE CAPABLE TO... CHANGE MEN'S MINDS" 
-JOHN LOCKE

"YET WOULD NOT THAT HELP AT ALL TO THE SALVATION OF THEIR SOULS."
-JOHN LOCKE

"THE NECESSITY TO QUIT THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN REASON, AND OPPOSE THE DICTATES OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES, AND BLINDLY TO RESIGN THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILL OF THEIR GOVERNORS"
-JOHN LOCKE

"A CHURCH, THEN, I TAKE TO BE A VOLUNTARY SOCIETY OF MEN, JOINING THEMSELVES TOGETHER OF THEIR OWN ACCORD IN ORDER TO THE PUBLIC WORSHIPPING OF GOD IN SUCH MANNER AS THEY JUDGE ACCEPTABLE"
-JOHN LOCKE

"NOBODY IS BORN A MEMBER OF ANY CHURCH; OTHERWISE THE RELIGION OF PARENTS WOULD DESCEND UNTO CHILDREN"
-JOHN LOCKE

"WITH RULING AUTHORITY DERIVED FROM THE VERY APOSTLES, AND CONTINUED DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIMES BY AN UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION."
-JOHN LOCKE

"THAT THE CHURCH OF CHRIST SHOULD PERSECUTE OTHERS, AND FORCE OTHERS BY FIRE AND SWORD TO EMBRACE HER FAITH AND DOCTRINE, I COULD NEVER YET FIND IN ANY OF THE BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT."

-JOHN LOCKE

"SECONDLY, NO PRIVATE PERSON HAS ANY RIGHT IN ANY MANNER TO PREJUDICE ANOTHER PERSON IN HIS CIVIL ENJOYMENTS BECAUSE HE IS OF ANOTHER CHURCH OR RELIGION."
-JOHN LOCKE

"THE CHURCH ITSELF IS A THING ABSOLUTELY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE COMMONWEALTH."

-JOHN LOCKE

"OR... LUSTFULLY POLLUTE THEMSELVES IN PROMISCUOUS UNCLEANNESS, OR PRACTISE... SUCH HEINOUS ENORMITIES, IS THE MAGISTRATE OBLIGED TO TOLERATE THEM"
-JOHN LOСКЕ





**HOW FAR DOES TOLERATION EXTEND?**

"THAT CHURCH CAN HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE TOLERATED BY THE MAGISTRATE WHICH IS CONSTITUTED UPON SUCH A BOTTOM THAT ALL THOSE WHO ENTER INTO IT DO THEREBY IPSO FACTO"
-JOHN LOCKE

"DELIVER THEMSELVES UP TO THE PROTECTION AND SERVICE OF ANOTHER PRINCE."
-JOHN LOCKE
