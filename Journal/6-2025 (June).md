We are warriors we take the roads untravelled, not because it's easy.
But because we must.

When adversities come we do what we do best, we take the roads untravelled.


There is no peace without life, But there is no life without conflict.



What something is, is not the same as what it means.
But to understand that you will need to do more than just watch, you will need to see.



Sometimes even if you know how somethings gonna end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.




No one can take what you are away from you, who you are will always be the part of what you become.


Every seed holds the promise of a mighty tree.


You don't always have to be brave, sometimes you just have to act brave.

If things stayed the same forever, sooner or later they'll loose their flavour.


If you stop seeing the world in terms for what you like and dislike; and saw things for what they truly are in themselves. You'll find a great deal more peace in your life.



The magic you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding.




Provide value for an extended period of time and eventually you will get rewarded. That's how the game of capitalism works .
