Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.

If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives — be kind anyway.
What you spend years building, someone can destroy overnight — build anyway.
The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow — do good anyway.
Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough — give the world the best you've got anyway.
You see, in the final analysis, it's between you and your God anyway.
