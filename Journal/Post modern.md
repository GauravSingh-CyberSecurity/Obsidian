"The essence of Dasein lies in its existence."
-**Martin Heidegger**


## EXISTENTIALISM IS A HUMANISM.                   (An Essay by Jean-Paul Sartre)


**EXISTENTIALISM**
A philosophical movement that explores the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

"My purpose here is to offer a defence of existentialism against several reproaches that have been laid against it. First, it has been reproached as an invitation to people to dwell in quietism of despair."

"From another quarter we are reproached for having underlined all that is ignominious in the human situation..."

"For since we ignore the commandments of God and all values prescribed as eternal, nothing remains but what is strictly voluntary. Everyone can do what he likes, and will be incapable, from such a point of view, of condemning either the point of view or the action of anyone else."


**DOGMATISM**
An expression of a belief or opinion as if it were a fact.
Often compared to stubbornness or narrow mindedness.

"What they have in common is simply the fact that they believe that existence comes before essence - or, if you will, that we must begin from the subjective."


The conception in the mind of the artisan, the paperknife maker, is the essence of what is to be a paperknife.


# ( Essence precedes existence. )
In essence, anything that exists, the essence of that thing was conceptualized before it came into existence.
Eg: A bulb, before even a bulb was created, it's essence was conceptualized by its creator. The creator first conceptualized that they want to bring in existence an electrical tool that can emit light, which must help humans to see at night. Then the engineering of the Bulb started and it was bought into existence.



"Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it...If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing."


"Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills, and as he conceives himself after already existing - as he wills to be after that leap towards existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself."

"Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism."

"Thus, the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders."

"And, when we say that man is responsible for himself, we do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for all men."

"Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of the individual subject and, on the other, that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity.

It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism. When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men."

"All the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be... Our responsibility is thus much greater than we had supposed, for it concerns mankind as a whole."

"When a man commits himself to anything, fully realising that he is not only choosing what he will be, but is thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind - in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility. There are many, indeed, who show no such anxiety. But we affirm that they are merely disguising their anguish or are in flight from it."


**ABRAHAM AND ISAAC**
The story of Abraham and Isaac appears in Genesis 22, where God tests Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, at Moriah.

In the Bible, Abraham is portrayed as a righteous man who is committed to God, compassionate, hospitable, and a man of peace. But In reality he is not righteous because he shifts responsibility of his actions on God and says God asked me to give the most unspeakable sacrifice, and he doesn't even question it. And How does he even know that the voice he heard is of God?


"And when we speak of "abandonment" - a favorite word of Heidegger - we only mean to say that God does not exist...There can no longer be any good a priori, since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it. It is nowhere written that 'the good' exists, that one must be honest or must not lie, since we are now upon the plane where there are only men. Dostoevsky once wrote: 'If God did not exist, everything would be permitted'..."


"...man is free, man is freedom. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. - We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free."

## THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS                         [A philosophical essay by Albert Camus ]
(published in 1942)

**SISYPHUS**
A figure from Greek mythology who is condemned for all eternity to roll a boulder up a mountain, only to watch it roll back down again as soon as he reaches the peak.


"The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor."

"This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. ...one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone...the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down..."

## "... he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock."


"If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious."

"The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd."

"If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy...There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth."

"All Sisyphus' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him... **==One must imagine Sisyphus happy.==** "


"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."

To ask ;
**Why Live? | Why not commit suicide?** Same thing.
They both are the same Question, but just with a shift in perspective!

**Why live?** : takes you towards creating your own meaning, purpose and commitment. It moves you towards taking the Fate you were given, and committing to that fate. Calling it "My fate"; "My carrer"; "My family" ; "My life"

**Why not commit suicide?** Takes you towards, nihilism, what is the meaning, saying the existence and life in itself is meaningless so everything that is, was and ever will be is all totally absurd. Because one day all will be dead and gone and forgotten.


Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were both leftists and existentialists.

==**Being willing to accept full responsibility for who you are , that is what an authentic human being will do.**==

But what most of the human beings do is want to shift that responsibility elsewhere, saying and even believing things like"God made me this way!" ; "society made me this way" ; I couldn't help it , my wrong doings are not because of me it's because so and so made me do it.

For **Exesitentialism** This is like it's first commandment: "you are responsible, and you step up to that responsibility or you don't "


How do you know the voice you think you hearing is the voice of God? And not of your own paranoid self or even the voices of bad spirits?

And then why should you not Questions these voices in your head , that are asking you to make the greatest sacrifices, why should you obey these voices if you do not know for sure it's the voice of God?

If I just obey without asking questions and not knowing the reason for the action I am doing or am supposed to do, I shift responsibility to someone else, "someone told me to do it, someone else made me do it"

But we are in that circumstances and we don't know what the right thing to do is, But we have to do something and we have to take full responsibility for it.

It is nowhere written that the good exists. Not in the mind of God, not in platonic forms, not built into the structure of nature. There is no True standards of Good and Bad.

So even if God exists or does not exists. Everything is permitted.

Even if God told you to do something, you still have choice to do it or not. And if he doesn't exists then there is no one to obey anyways.
So whatever you choose it's totally your responsibility and no one else's.
That is why:-
"...man is free, man is freedom. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. - We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that **man is condemned to be free**."


That is the wonderful , rhetorical , paradoxical Truth of human beings:
"We are free, and we cannot escape the fact that we are free." That is what it is to be a human being, a choosing being.
A pure potential that can go anywhere, and any attempts to escape that is an irresponsiblity, you have to accept it.

The absurdity of existence is there lies no inherent meaning to life. The meaning of life lies in what we give to it.
So you can't find purpose or meaning of life, you have to create it in life.

 You give life meaning by embracing the fate you’ve been given and making it your own. Meaning comes when you choose to commit—to say, “This is my fate, and I accept it,” “This is my family, and I stand by them,” or “This is not just a job, but my career, and I dedicate myself to it.” It’s a shift in perspective: instead of seeing life as an absurd, meaningless journey destined to fade into nothingness, you begin to see it as your own personal path. By willingly committing to what you must do in life and making it truly yours, you find purpose. In that commitment, you discover joy and fulfillment—not because the task changes, but because your perspective do.
 
**==You have to will yourself into joy.==**
