**What are my right reasons/ my success**, I'll just take all these topics: football, swimming, running , workout,science, philosophy, hacking, cyber security, coding, psychology ; that I am interested in to find out:

1) it made me feel excited, confidence 
2) I like to do it because of the challenge, it was hard and not everyone was good at it. The harder it was the better. Eg football 
3) I liked working hard to become better at it and it gave me satisfaction that I was getting better then I was yesterday 
4) I liked the competition, I liked to win and defeat my opponent. I liked to know that I was better at something then everyone else 
5) I liked it's volatile nature of the skill, I liked that if I stopped training this skill will perish and someone else will get better than me, so I loved to train, to stay at the top
6) I felt strong, confident, I felt excited every day to do it. I felt happy to do it. I wanted to do it all day long.
7) I had a purpose, to become a master at my skill.
8) I liked to win, win and keep winning and when I lost, I was fired up twice more and wouldn't stop till I won again and again and again.
9) Failure meant more doing it, it meant more training instead of giving up
10) The golden rule was never give up, play the game even if I was tired , dizzy, broken nose, cramped legs, sore feet and nerve strain in fingers of feet, numerous foot blisters, still I wanted to play, still I wanted to train in that pain I loved to train, I did it no matter what adversity came in my face 
11) I never counted hours while doing it, I never wanted to or even cared to.
12) The pain and suffering of doing it somehow made me happy, it brought me a lot of joy knowing that I am so strong that I can suffer all this and become better still, and knowing that even when injured and not at my best I was better than everyone.
13) I wanted to keep doing it my whole life 
14) Note : when I started out football I was no good, just a little bit naturally gifted and a lot of excitement .
15) same thing I have for cybersecurity and hacking 
16) the journey was the success, everyday training was the success, winning daily was the success 
17) I achieved Zone, I was able to get in the Zone when I played football. And the Zone only comes after achieving mastery.
18) confidence, competitive , thrill seeking, adventures nature, the sense of learning new things , mastering new things and taking pride in my hardwork.   morale,   self confidence, competitive and fearless nature.  
19) I failed, lost and trained , and kept training till I was the best. And even then kept training and became better every day.
20) I will never make the mistake of seeking appreciation of others when I know I am the best. Not be bound by appreciation or disappointment of my parents 
21) I will not let anyone else tell me what is the success or right reasons for me. No one else defines it for me, only I do.
22) I loved playing football once I became good, till then I had the feeling of wanting to become good at it so I trained and kept training. Same feeling I have for cyber security feeling of wanting to be good, now all I need to do is training like I did with football, for this is my new football.(Hacking/coding is my new football)


I will become that kid again, that Football team captain who was the best on the ground.


Get busy living or get busy dying.
