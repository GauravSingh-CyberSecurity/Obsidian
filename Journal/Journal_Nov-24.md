# 4-Nov-2024

When we were young, the years passing by used to bring a feeling of excitement, a sense of new challenges that we were eager to face, new opportunities that we were eager to chase.
Now every year passing by seems terrifying, like I need to get success and I am not there yet, like I am delayed and wasted yet another year and have even less time.
Maybe I will change this attitude, I will go back to the adolescent way of approaching the years, I will think of them as a gift like I used to when I was young.



Now what happened why did I stopped thinking like that, maybe because of the pressure from my mother telling me I need to achieve this, achieve that.
Everyones sons, daughters have done this done that, they earn this much they earn that much. What are you gonna do and so on. My friends wo are either terrified or don't even bother, we started living in extremes, instead of living in our dreams, visions. The world beat this sense of urgency in me that I need to be successful before 30, I need to get money, get higher education, get this get that or else I will be a disappointment, and the fear of failing to achieve this, fear of being a disappointment got in my subconscious and with every day, week, month, year passing by it keeps growing and it became so big that it has just paralyzed my senses of creativity, seeking adventure, chasing new ideas, experimenting, leaving room for failure because all these things will take up more of my time and delay so called success, so I started to look for roadmaps made by someone else , so I can just parrot those things and get the so called success. But obviously that is not what I want or else I wouldn't be writing this down.

So in summary world beat the sense of urgency to get success in me , that lead to the embedded fear in my subconscious that has been paralyzing me from trying to do anything, in fear of failing, because failure might eat up my time and that the urgency doesn't allow.
But the good news is, when I look back I can still remember the time when I didn't have this sense of urgency, year passing by were not a curse but a blessing.
When I seek and carried a sense of adventure with every coming year.
Learned new skills, mastered those skills,
That made me confident that made me strong. I am talking about football, maths, science you know , I used to play video games because goddam good at that also.
I was a thrill seeker , and the most competitive person, I used to compete at everything video games, football, swimming, studying in school and in tution.

But my father and mother beat this sense in me that I am no good. That I am useless, my father he literally told me that my skill of football, swimming, I mean anything apart from studying is useless.
Then in studying even though I was pretty good, instead of showing appreciation he and she both just showed disappointment, they showed disappointment willingly, like if I would get 45 out of 50 marks they won't be happy, instead would say you lost 5 marks.
It was always glass half empty for them when it came to us, and the comparisons with others that never ends, it's still going on even.
Because of there glass half empty attitude, the young kid which I was lost his moral, confidence, competitive and fearless nature, why, because I started to somewhere in between, maybe subconsciously, started trying to please them (my parents ) , since they were never happy with me, never showed appreciation, (all those things like you are too short in height, you are dark in colour, you are too skinny, too fat, don't make friends, don't make girlfriends they are the reason you are bad because we didn't teach you this , your friends should never come at home and all the fucking mindless torture of these idiots), I just wanted a little bit of appreciation so I started chasing it , and in that process I left that boy behind.
And now I find this person here .

I can't change my parents, but I can identify what happened and change myself back again the way I liked myself.

It became a ritual for them a habit to criticize us instead of appreciating, and now it's like embedded in there DNAs it like a tattoo on there minds. Not to appreciate my son's, but to criticize them and find fault and imperfections in anything they do.

Conclusion is:
1) I was a young kind who was competitive, excited to see coming years, liked to learn new skills and mastered them, was confident in myself , because damn good at everything he touched.
2) never got appreciation from parents so thought I was useless, let them decide for me what is useful and what is useless
3) Devloped a sense of urgency to get to so called success, and that too not by my choice, it was beaten down in me by my parents.
4) Became paralyzed by the fear of failing because someone else (parents, mother and father ) made the decision for what my success looks like and if I don't achieve that then I am a failure, and they very cunningly put it such that I think that it's my plan and not there's.
5) now I want to go back to being that kid who actually was good at doing things and didn't care for failure because for him falling down was never failure but a chance to rise up stroger and thats what ge did 
6) the mistake that I made as a kid is I thought that if parents are saying then it correct and right thing to do for me and I practically left my confidence, competitive , thrill seeking, adventures nature behind, the sense of learning new things , mastering new things and taking pride in my hardwork. I just dropped all of it .
Now I am going back to being that person and fuck everyone.
Fuck the parents, fuck there thoughts and ideas for me , and my god fuck em hard.
For now I do what I do for all the right reasons:

**What are my right reasons/ my success**, I'll just take all these topics: football, swimming, running , workout,science, philosophy, hacking, cyber security, coding, psychology ; that I am interested in to find out:

1) it made me feel excited, confidence 
2) I like to do it because of the challenge, it was hard and not everyone was good at it. The harder it was the better. Eg football 
3) I liked working hard to become better at it and it gave me satisfaction that I was getting better then I was yesterday 
4) I liked the competition, I liked to win and defeat my opponent. I liked to know that I was better at something then everyone else 
5) I liked it's volatile nature of the skill, I liked that if I stopped training this skill will perish and someone else will get better than me, so I loved to train, to stay at the top
6) I felt strong, confident, I felt excited every day to do it. I felt happy to do it. I wanted to do it all day long.
7) I had a purpose, to become a master at my skill.
8) I liked to win, win and keep winning and when I lost, I was fired up twice more and wouldn't stop till I won again and again and again.
9) Failure meant more doing it, it meant more training instead of giving up
10) The golden rule was never give up, play the game even if I was tired , dizzy, broken nose, cramped legs, sore feet and nerve strain in fingers of feet, numerous foot blisters, still I wanted to play, still I wanted to train in that pain I loved to train, I did it no matter what adversity came in my face 
11) I never counted hours while doing it, I never wanted to or even cared to.
12) The pain and suffering of doing it somehow made me happy, it brought me a lot of joy knowing that I am so strong that I can suffer all this and become better still, and knowing that even when injured and not at my best I was better than everyone.
13) I wanted to keep doing it my whole life 
14) Note : when I started out football I was no good, just a little bit naturally gifted and a lot of excitement .
15) same thing I have for cybersecurity and hacking 
16) the journey was the success, everyday training was the success, winning daily was the success 
17) I achieved Zone, I was able to get in the Zone when I played football. And the Zone only comes after achieving mastery.
18) confidence, competitive , thrill seeking, adventures nature, the sense of learning new things , mastering new things and taking pride in my hardwork.   morale,   self confidence, competitive and fearless nature.  
19) I failed, lost and trained , and kept training till I was the best. And even then kept training and became better every day.
20) I will never make the mistake of seeking appreciation of others when I know I am the best. Not be bound by appreciation or disappointment of my parents 
21) I will not let anyone else tell me what is the success or right reasons for me. No one else defines it for me, only I do.
22) I loved playing football once I became good, till then I had the feeling of wanting to become good at it so I trained and kept training. Same feeling I have for cyber security feeling of wanting to be good, now all I need to do is training like I did with football, for this is my new football.**(Hacking/coding is my new football)**


I will become that kid again, that Football team captain who was the best on the ground.


All parents are so focused to make sure that there kids have a , good job and earn good money that they forget to ask the kid what is its calling in life what gives purpose to that kid in life.
This way we are not making good humans, we are just making half dead zombies that are not even close to being a human.
Who are out of touch of themselves there own conscience.


I want to be ecstatic, I want to be free in my own way 


The biggest responsibility of adult you is ki apne bachpan ko bacha ka rakhna.


Ask myself what will I need to do to be motivated to do the work.


Ask yourself everyday, What could I do that I would do to make life a little bit better

Old age and treachery will always overpower youth and skill.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.


When a man sees his end he wants to know there was some purpose to his life, how will the world speak my name in years to come.
Will I be known as the philosopher, technologist, tyrant

Ancestors I honour you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

Four chief virtues according to stoicism:
1) ***==wisdom==*** : The ability to discern(recognise) what is truly good, bad, and indifferent(neither), guiding rational decision-making and understanding of life's values
2) ***==justice==*** : Acting with fairness and integrity towards others, emphasizing moral responsibility in all interactions. This is most crucial virtue of all.
3) ***==fortitued==*** : courage and resilience in face of adversity 
4) ***==temperance==*** : moderation and balance in life (eg: balance of chaos and order the ☯️ yin Yang)

I don't believe in equality for it is a very vague term, what is equality. Does it mean deeming a murderer and a martyr equal or does it mean to men of different religion are equal or a young ignorant adolescent and the prime minister equal. Or do they mean men and women both of th genders are equal or does it mean equality of outcome for everyone if so then a lazy entitled idiot and a hard working billionaire should both have equal amount of money, knowledge, power if that would have been the case then we all know that we wouldn't even have this mobile phone on which I am journaling.

This world deserves justice not equality, for what is justice how does someone gets justice, it's the laws and virtues by which mankind decides
To govern themselves, and when these laws are followed or broken the person who does so must face the consequences of there actions good or bad.

Let's take for example modern utoy feminists who say the they want equality , they want to be equal as men . Well in this world where in reality even men are not equal to each other how could this statement be possible let alone correct.

If we agree to this narrative what does it mean , will you put **Madam Marie Curie** and some out of her mind , yelling on the street so called feminist women at an equal level of intelligence, recognition, accomplishments, wealth, wisdom, glory. Does the sacrifice of a greatest scientist and a bottom dwelling nighilist protester equal.

Did Einstein got equality when he was chased out of his own country for being a Jew, did Nicola Tesla got equality of wealth in accordance to his genius or did Alan turing was treated equally for being gay.
No , but the world gave them justice, justice to their name , their legacy, their sacrifice.

No human can ever really be equal irrespective of genders, for if it was True then there would be no space left for individuality.
What we should strive for instead is justice for everyone, all groups, communities, societies of all types.

Justice promotes humans to strive to be better and good.
For justice means glory to the sacrifice of a martyr and also death to the monsters and enemies of beings.


The strength of a man is not measured by how much pain he can inflict on others, but by how much he can endure and still able to stand up for righteousness.

I wish I could believe that when we die it's not over, that maybe we go somewhere, someplace else, someplace beautiful.
I wish..


Death smiles at us all, all you can do is smile back.

I examined the poets, and I look on them as people whose talent overawes both themselves and others, people who present themselves as wise men and are taken as such, when they are nothing of the sort.

From poets, I moved to artists. No one was more ignorant about the arts than I; no one was more convinced that artists possessed really beautiful secrets. However, I noticed that their condition was no better than that of the poets and that both of them have the same misconceptions. Because the most skillful among them excel in their specialty, they look upon themselves as the wisest of men. In my eyes, this presumption completely tarnished their knowledge. As a result, putting myself in the place of the oracle and asking myself what I would prefer to be — what I was or what they were, to know what they have learned or to know that I know nothing — I replied to myself and to the god: I wish to remain who I am.

We do not know — neither the sophists, nor the orators, nor the artists, nor I— what the True, the Good, and the Beautiful are. But there is this difference between us: although these people know nothing, they all believe they know something; whereas, I, if I know nothing, at least have no doubts about it. As a result, all this superiority in wisdom which the oracle has attributed to me reduces itself to the single point that I am strongly convinced that I am ignorant of what I do not know.
-Socrates



We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.

# 15-11-2024

I became evil by my own ignorance, I lied to others and myself that I fight someone, and beat someone because I am defending my own.
I am fighting for my loved ones , but that's a lie , if I wanted to make things better for my people. I would keep violence as the last resort for their oppressors, I would first try and negotiate or give a warning to them to stay in order.
No but what I did is I chose violence,and I did that to assert my dominance. I did that to feel that power of being able to control others fate. And I lied to the world and even convinced myself that  I am fighting for my loved ones, so this act of violence is actually virtuous and courageous and far from evil.





# 16-Nov-2024

Why does anyone commit acts , others deem unspeakable?  for Love..





If you want someones trust there are only three things you need to do to get it:
1) Be honest, Even if it's brutal 
2) be patient 
3) And shut the fuck up. (That means keep their secrets)





Knowledge is a paradox. 
The more one understands, the more one realises the vastness of his ignorance.

The message hidden under the patterns of our nature, it's inescapable. 
Humanity!
Our very essence, our emotions.
rage and compassion, two sides of a same coin inextricably bound.
That which inspires us to our greatest good is also the cause of our greatest evil.

Sanjay in last two months he has not picked up my calls 68 times, and only time he bothers to go out with me is when I am paying for drinking or paying for smoking, I have reached to this conclusion that he is a freeloader and he is used to only stick with me because I helped him with studies and stuff and I paid for things that's it, he never bothers to call me , he didn't even bother to call me on his birthday or invite me to birthday party, on the contrary I had to call him up and even spend my money on his party.
Shit after calculating I find out I have spent 20000 rs on him in 5 months.
He is with me just for this and is not really a friend because if he was then I wouldn't be thinking this or writing this.
A true friend does not make you feel like this, the fact that I have felt this and realised this means I will never ever be friends with him again. I will be just like he is with me , just for convenience and won't spend a dime or time on him.

Because fuck him, it's hard to accept this because this means I don't have any friends whatsoever and that thought is more terrifying but still it's true.
Today I realise he is not the one to be by my side, so I won't be by his either.

I will not pick at least 30 of his call, and I will not pick his call till he has called me more than 10 times in a single day.

When a man is weak and too lazy to do anything about it, he blames people around him for his failure and weakness. Like I did above to the best friend of my life, and probably like he's doing to me as well by the way he is behaving.
But how can I change him when I am the same weak man right now, indiscipline, slave to my emotions, lying to myself. Even though my conscience is a little bit more mature and devloped and my inner voices knows exactly what to do and what is right for me to grow even more.
My indiscipline self will never move forward with the work my inner voices tell it to do unless I start having a little discipline.
I start from now right now, I will train to be a stronger man every day, so that I can take some responsibility for life and my actions, and learn how not to fall into my cravings and emotions and addictions.
It's not that simple, like others I am the same , it means like if I told anyone else to just be a whole different human being and change their nature in a snap they will probably just listen and ignore me, same is with myself, even if I tell myself do all these things and in a snap be someone else that is not how I will change. I am a human and I have a nature, I must act accordingly and shape myself with help of understanding what I got as clay to make the pot, clay being the type of my individuality of my nature and pot is the desired outcome that my inner voices tells me to be.

And note to myself, always listen to the inner voices make it your mission to keep the inner voices, all of them and their dialogues alive and articulate at all time without letting them falling into chaos, and devlop & grow with the help of them, as they already provide you a little base to grow on. But there is no limit for aiming up so we will be infinite.

So The game of inner voices and myself starts, we must wrestle with eachother and train ourselves to grow , physically and intellectually.


I need to treat myself with alignment to my nature, like if I like little rewards to feel sense of achievement after doing a task , I must reward myself.
Like after studying for 2 hours I might reward myself 20 min of nap.
Or after working out hard I might reward myself a protein shake.
I can use the positive reinforcement on myself if that may work with me, or I may use the technique of training without purpose, or maybe research some more options that may align precisely with my own human nature and if none of the technique exists for my individual Human nature, I must build my own technique and then use it.
And the technique is not something rigid like a schedule, rather this technique is an evolving solution that evolves every moment with my own being till I die.
For there is nothing in me that I will ever stop from evolving and take away the chance for growing more.

Thinking is listening to yourself and I will always try and become a better listener everyday of my life.
I will use this technique as well, "Listen to myself, repeat  very clearly what I was thinking and the answer should be of my satisfaction. Only then my conscience/inner voices start to reply"
And this goes on at every statement made by each inner voices. The others listen and then repeat it clearly and if that articulation is of my satisfaction move ahead to give a reply/answer/solution/another question.
And obviously write down my thoughts, and I also devlop the skill of writing my mind down every day. And I am moving towards growth and mastery everyday. For even every master of his craft still must have a place he would purse as calling that place mastery.
In that sense every master is striving for even more mastery till the end of his time.




The ironic tragedy is that life has to be lived forward but only makes sense in reverse.
