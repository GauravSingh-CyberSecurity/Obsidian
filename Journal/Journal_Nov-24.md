# 4-Nov-2024

When we were young, the years passing by used to bring a feeling of excitement, a sense of new challenges that we were eager to face, new opportunities that we were eager to chase.
Now every year passing by seems terrifying, like I need to get success and I am not there yet, like I am delayed and wasted yet another year and have even less time.
Maybe I will change this attitude, I will go back to the adolescent way of approaching the years, I will think of them as a gift like I used to when I was young.



Now what happened why did I stopped thinking like that, maybe because of the pressure from my mother telling me I need to achieve this, achieve that.
Everyones sons, daughters have done this done that, they earn this much they earn that much. What are you gonna do and so on. My friends wo are either terrified or don't even bother, we started living in extremes, instead of living in our dreams, visions. The world beat this sense of urgency in me that I need to be successful before 30, I need to get money, get higher education, get this get that or else I will be a disappointment, and the fear of failing to achieve this, fear of being a disappointment got in my subconscious and with every day, week, month, year passing by it keeps growing and it became so big that it has just paralyzed my senses of creativity, seeking adventure, chasing new ideas, experimenting, leaving room for failure because all these things will take up more of my time and delay so called success, so I started to look for roadmaps made by someone else , so I can just parrot those things and get the so called success. But obviously that is not what I want or else I wouldn't be writing this down.

So in summary world beat the sense of urgency to get success in me , that lead to the embedded fear in my subconscious that has been paralyzing me from trying to do anything, in fear of failing, because failure might eat up my time and that the urgency doesn't allow.
But the good news is, when I look back I can still remember the time when I didn't have this sense of urgency, year passing by were not a curse but a blessing.
When I seek and carried a sense of adventure with every coming year.
Learned new skills, mastered those skills,
That made me confident that made me strong. I am talking about football, maths, science you know , I used to play video games because goddam good at that also.
I was a thrill seeker , and the most competitive person, I used to compete at everything video games, football, swimming, studying in school and in tution.

But my father and mother beat this sense in me that I am no good. That I am useless, my father he literally told me that my skill of football, swimming, I mean anything apart from studying is useless.
Then in studying even though I was pretty good, instead of showing appreciation he and she both just showed disappointment, they showed disappointment willingly, like if I would get 45 out of 50 marks they won't be happy, instead would say you lost 5 marks.
It was always glass half empty for them when it came to us, and the comparisons with others that never ends, it's still going on even.
Because of there glass half empty attitude, the young kid which I was lost his moral, confidence, competitive and fearless nature, why, because I started to somewhere in between, maybe subconsciously, started trying to please them (my parents ) , since they were never happy with me, never showed appreciation, (all those things like you are too short in height, you are dark in colour, you are too skinny, too fat, don't make friends, don't make girlfriends they are the reason you are bad because we didn't teach you this , your friends should never come at home and all the fucking mindless torture of these idiots), I just wanted a little bit of appreciation so I started chasing it , and in that process I left that boy behind.
And now I find this person here .

I can't change my parents, but I can identify what happened and change myself back again the way I liked myself.

It became a ritual for them a habit to criticize us instead of appreciating, and now it's like embedded in there DNAs it like a tattoo on there minds. Not to appreciate my son's, but to criticize them and find fault and imperfections in anything they do.

Conclusion is:
1) I was a young kind who was competitive, excited to see coming years, liked to learn new skills and mastered them, was confident in myself , because damn good at everything he touched.
2) never got appreciation from parents so thought I was useless, let them decide for me what is useful and what is useless
3) Devloped a sense of urgency to get to so called success, and that too not by my choice, it was beaten down in me by my parents.
4) Became paralyzed by the fear of failing because someone else (parents, mother and father ) made the decision for what my success looks like and if I don't achieve that then I am a failure, and they very cunningly put it such that I think that it's my plan and not there's.
5) now I want to go back to being that kid who actually was good at doing things and didn't care for failure because for him falling down was never failure but a chance to rise up stroger and thats what ge did 
6) the mistake that I made as a kid is I thought that if parents are saying then it correct and right thing to do for me and I practically left my confidence, competitive , thrill seeking, adventures nature behind, the sense of learning new things , mastering new things and taking pride in my hardwork. I just dropped all of it .
Now I am going back to being that person and fuck everyone.
Fuck the parents, fuck there thoughts and ideas for me , and my god fuck em hard.
For now I do what I do for all the right reasons:

**What are my right reasons/ my success**, I'll just take all these topics: football, swimming, running , workout,science, philosophy, hacking, cyber security, coding, psychology ; that I am interested in to find out:

1) it made me feel excited, confidence 
2) I like to do it because of the challenge, it was hard and not everyone was good at it. The harder it was the better. Eg football 
3) I liked working hard to become better at it and it gave me satisfaction that I was getting better then I was yesterday 
4) I liked the competition, I liked to win and defeat my opponent. I liked to know that I was better at something then everyone else 
5) I liked it's volatile nature of the skill, I liked that if I stopped training this skill will perish and someone else will get better than me, so I loved to train, to stay at the top
6) I felt strong, confident, I felt excited every day to do it. I felt happy to do it. I wanted to do it all day long.
7) I had a purpose, to become a master at my skill.
8) I liked to win, win and keep winning and when I lost, I was fired up twice more and wouldn't stop till I won again and again and again.
9) Failure meant more doing it, it meant more training instead of giving up
10) The golden rule was never give up, play the game even if I was tired , dizzy, broken nose, cramped legs, sore feet and nerve strain in fingers of feet, numerous foot blisters, still I wanted to play, still I wanted to train in that pain I loved to train, I did it no matter what adversity came in my face 
11) I never counted hours while doing it, I never wanted to or even cared to.
12) The pain and suffering of doing it somehow made me happy, it brought me a lot of joy knowing that I am so strong that I can suffer all this and become better still, and knowing that even when injured and not at my best I was better than everyone.
13) I wanted to keep doing it my whole life 
14) Note : when I started out football I was no good, just a little bit naturally gifted and a lot of excitement .
15) same thing I have for cybersecurity and hacking 
16) the journey was the success, everyday training was the success, winning daily was the success 
17) I achieved Zone, I was able to get in the Zone when I played football. And the Zone only comes after achieving mastery.
18) confidence, competitive , thrill seeking, adventures nature, the sense of learning new things , mastering new things and taking pride in my hardwork.   morale,   self confidence, competitive and fearless nature.  
19) I failed, lost and trained , and kept training till I was the best. And even then kept training and became better every day.
20) I will never make the mistake of seeking appreciation of others when I know I am the best. Not be bound by appreciation or disappointment of my parents 
21) I will not let anyone else tell me what is the success or right reasons for me. No one else defines it for me, only I do.
22) I loved playing football once I became good, till then I had the feeling of wanting to become good at it so I trained and kept training. Same feeling I have for cyber security feeling of wanting to be good, now all I need to do is training like I did with football, for this is my new football.**(Hacking/coding is my new football)**


I will become that kid again, that Football team captain who was the best on the ground.


All parents are so focused to make sure that there kids have a , good job and earn good money that they forget to ask the kid what is its calling in life what gives purpose to that kid in life.
This way we are not making good humans, we are just making half dead zombies that are not even close to being a human.
Who are out of touch of themselves there own conscience.


I want to be ecstatic, I want to be free in my own way 


The biggest responsibility of adult you is ki apne bachpan ko bacha ka rakhna.


Ask myself what will I need to do to be motivated to do the work.


Ask yourself everyday, What could I do that I would do to make life a little bit better

Old age and treachery will always overpower youth and skill.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.


When a man sees his end he wants to know there was some purpose to his life, how will the world speak my name in years to come.
Will I be known as the philosopher, technologist, tyrant

Ancestors I honour you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.


4 chief virtues:
1) wisdom 
2) justice 
3) fortitued 
4) temperance
