How long can a man survive without love, hope, future. I suppose a lifetime.
But how long can he live without it, not a day.

So I forgot the birthday of my friend Akansha (my colleague from my first job in harrier information systems, the first friend of mine there)
It deeply hurt her.
So to return the favour to hurt me equally, they decide to break the friendship and made the choice to just be professional colleague from then on.

And she did succeed in her intention,
It was a sudden change in situation, and the fact that someone I let in after 4-5 months of analysis I accepted them as a friend in my heart and led my walls down, showed them my heart.
And now suddenly they decide to end it , it came to me as a shock, first few days it took me time to even take in and assess the situation.

This feeling of shock and unpredicted landscape make me feel like tearing up in my eyes.
Yes they did hurt me , maybe more then I did them. But that's not
