How long can a man survive without love, hope, future. I suppose a lifetime.
But how long can he live without it, not a day.

So I forgot the birthday of my friend Akansha (my colleague from my first job in harrier information systems, the first friend of mine there)
It deeply hurt her.
So to return the favour to hurt me equally, they decide to break the friendship and made the choice to just be professional colleague from then on.

And she did succeed in her intention,
It was a sudden change in situation, and the fact that someone I let in after 4-5 months of analysis I accepted them as a friend in my heart and led my walls down, showed them my heart.
And now suddenly they decide to end it , it came to me as a shock, first few days it took me time to even take in and assess the situation.

This feeling of shock and unpredicted landscape make me feel like tearing up in my eyes.
Yes they did hurt me , maybe more then I did them. But that's not the point, I can accept the pain.

But the fact that they think this is so simple, that they can end a frendship that was built slowly over half a year of time in a moment because they feel like it , The fact that this decision holds a power over me and control how I feel, is what I can't accept.

I can't have anyone holding such kind of power over me with active intention of exploiting that just for the sake of there pleasure, 
And to save the sovereignty of my conscience I must oblige with this decision of theirs.
And make sure never to give them my friendship again for they don't care for it enough.

It was their decision
