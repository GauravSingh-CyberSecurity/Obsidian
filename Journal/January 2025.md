How long can a man survive without love, hope, future. I suppose a lifetime.
But how long can he live without it, not a day.

So I forgot the birthday of my friend Akansha (my colleague from my first job in harrier information systems, the first friend of mine there)
It deeply hurt her.
So to return the favour to hurt me equally, they decide to break the friendship and made the choice to just be professional colleague from then on.

And she did succeed in her intention,
It was a sudden change in situation, and the fact that someone I let in after 4-5 months of carefully building up of relationship, I accepted them as a friend in my heart and led my walls down, showed them my heart.
And now suddenly they decide to end it , it came to me as a shock, first few days it took me time to even take in and assess the situation.

This feeling of shock and unpredicted landscape make me feel like tearing up in my eyes.
Yes they did hurt me , maybe more then I did them. But that's not the point, I can accept the pain.

But the fact that they think this is so simple, that they can end a frendship that was built slowly over half a year of time in a moment because they feel like it , The fact that this decision holds a power over me and control how I feel, is what I can't accept.

I can't have anyone holding such kind of power over me with active intention of exploiting that just for the sake of there pleasure of hurting me, 

And to save the sovereignty of my conscience I must oblige with this decision of theirs.
And make sure never to give them my friendship again for they don't care for it enough.

It was their decision to end it, and yes I tried to persuade them otherwise.

Maybe they thought that they will teach me a lesson, and afterwards when I am punished enough according to them, they'll let me off the hook.
Or maybe they thought that this is the final decision and I don't really matter enough to be given a second thought.
Whatever it maybe, 

I can't have the same story play out again, for me a friend is like single soul dwelling in two bodies, and friends don't think of torturing each other .

It did came as a shock for the first  day and hurt me , because I didn't have time to reflect , but with days passing by I was able to take hold of my situation, got time to reflect and understand things.
For pain is I can take hurt is I can tolerate it's no problem.

But I won't let anyone control me , make me feel guilty, hold my conscience hostage and make me feel paralyzed with shock .

After suffering it once , I swear not to go through it again.
For they burnt the bridges, I must keep the walls up and wolves out .

Here I mourn my feelings for I have lost a friend. A friend I will never have again.













In a world with majority of mediocre humans , now Mediocrity has become more acceptable, tolerable and allowed then mastery of self and rising above as a glorious entity of life.

The educational institution tell you in name of knowledge, There exists in the world a single path along which no one can go except you: whither does it lead? Do not ask, go along it.
And someday if you haven't become willfully blind, ignorant, like you were trained to be,
