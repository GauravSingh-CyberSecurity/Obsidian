1.  ***5 min rule***: do ***short tasks immediately*** that will probably take less than 5 min,  if you don't feel like doing something just think about ***starting a timer and doing it for just 5 min*** , probably you'll find your momentum use it mostly for setback tasks as well as other tasks.




2. ***Focus timer*** (POMODORO technique ):                                     25 min of focus then 5 min of chill .  Or in my case                                  ***90 min of focus and 10 min of chill.*** Don't fall for ***FOMO***(fear of missing out) illusion created by today's digital/social media world.




3. ***Daily and weekly Goals*** : 
 - Make every next week plan on Friday
 
   On Monday check:
 - What is a priority 
 - What needs to be done 
 - When it must be done in this week.

Generally have a goal for a month or.   3-4 or 6 months.  Not more than that.



4. ***Routine*** (Morning & sleep)
	Divide your day and work in 3 blocks .

	3 different major work a day (12-18) hours of work every day.




5. ***Step away from desk*** and take little vacations 

	Go out at least once a day
	Workout 
	Run 
	Make coffee 




6. ***Dopamine*** : the level of dopamine you have give you will to work. Use it properly and give every task most bare minimum amount that is required to complete the task.

I.e don't get hyped up while running or workout, don't get low studying and other things. Maintain the dopamine level at a stable state that helps you do everything that you have to do for the day.

Don't waste dopamine by getting hyped up at a single task just stay at same dopamine level you want to for the whole day .

Don't burn up your dopamine for getting motivated you'll  end up feeling that you are done for the day after the particular task.

Live without motivation and with stable dopamine level. 
Stay calm and preserve all your dopamine in order to strech it out for the whole day.

If you burn most of the dopamine and you are At low dopamine 
You'll feel like you are done for the day 

So make a routine, discipline and strong will power and think about long term goal and not just particular task so you can automatically preserve the dopamine.



***Don't chase a constant "high":*** Dopamine's role goes beyond just pleasure. It also influences motivation, focus, and learning. A balanced dopamine system is more important than constantly spiking it.
