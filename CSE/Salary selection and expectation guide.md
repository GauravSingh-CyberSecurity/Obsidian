Is 6 month enough to switch from 3.5 lpa inr to search for new job with higher salary if not then how much time is and also tell me the a road map of salarys that I should try to secure one after other like 3.5 lpa to 5 lpa to 8 lap inr with the experience period

Based on the search results provided, here is a concise response to your query:

The typical salary progression for a software developer in India is as follows:

- Entry-level (0-2 years experience): 5-8 LPA
- Mid-level (2-5 years experience): 8-12 LPA 
- Senior (5+ years experience): 12-15 LPA or more[1]

For a developer starting at 3.5 LPA, it is reasonable to expect a salary increase to 5 LPA within 1-2 years of experience[1][2]. However, a jump from 3.5 LPA to 8 LPA within 6 months would be highly unlikely and unrealistic[2][5]. 

A more practical roadmap could be:

- 0-2 years: 3.5 LPA to 5 LPA
- 2-5 years: 5 LPA to 8-10 LPA
- 5+ years: 10 LPA to 12-15 LPA or higher[1][3]

The key is to consistently develop your skills and experience over time. Switching jobs every 6 months is generally not advisable, as employers value stability and long-term growth. Focus on delivering strong performance at your current role before considering a move[2].
