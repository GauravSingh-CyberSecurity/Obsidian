what should I learn as full stack

To become a full stack developer, you should learn the following key skills:

1. **HTML/CSS**: These are the building blocks of web development. HTML structures the content on the web, while CSS is used for styling the HTML elements[1][3][4].

2. **JavaScript**: Essential for making web pages interactive. Consider learning a JavaScript framework like React.js, Angular.js, or Vue.js to speed up development[1][3][4].

3. **Backend Programming**: Choose a backend language (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js) and thoroughly understand server-side operations, APIs, and databases[1][3][4].

4. **Databases and Web Storage**: Familiarize yourself with both SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases[1][3][4].

5. **Web Architecture**: Understand HTTP protocols, REST, GraphQL, and web security practices[1][3][4].

6. **Full Stack Framework or Stack**: Depending on your backend language, learn a relevant full stack framework or a popular stack like MEAN or MERN[1][3][4].

7. **DevOps and Cloud Services**: Learn about containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)[1][3][4].

8. **Practice**: Work on real-life projects, contribute to open-source projects, and build your portfolio[1][3][4].

By mastering these skills, you will be well-equipped to handle both frontend and backend aspects of web development, making you a full stack developer[1][3][4].
