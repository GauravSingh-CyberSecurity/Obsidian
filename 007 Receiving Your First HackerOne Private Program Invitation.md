00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,950
Getting your first private invite on Hakka one or under the party platform could become a challenging

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,400
thing.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,690
Lucky for us, Hakura one has a platform called Hakobyan one one.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,510
We can go on to the CTF platform right here, solve some challenges and earn an invitation to a private

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:15,970
program.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's check this out really quick.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,280
You go to Hakura one, go ahead and click on CTF.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,220
Log in and use your login Whiteaker one dot com to get access to this platform.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,100
So again, you don't have to sign up for a another account.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,090
All this could be done with whatever account you use on Hoshko on itself.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,950
There are a variety of different sites available here that you could solve some being on the easier

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,840
and versus moderate or hard.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,670
But each time you solve these and get 26 points, then you will earn a private invite.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,400
So you can see right here, if you earn twenty six points by solving multiple different CTF levels,

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,260
you will get a private invitation.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,780
So let's that you have picked one of your CTF levels.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,920
You can click go.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,900
This will open up your own dedicated instance where you can hack on this particular application and

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,170
once you're done it will spit out a flag where you can take it and go into the submit flag function

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,670
and submit it right here.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,810
And once you have done so, it will tell you how many points you have and how many points you missing

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,060
until your next invite is lucky for us.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,890
HOKA one has given us this flag right here.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,390
You can submit this to the website.

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,330
You can get your first private invite on Hakobyan and you can get to use your skills to earn your first

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,590
bounty and find your first book.
