We have such a responsibility to guide our young so that they don't end up falling apart, falling by the wayside, becoming insignificant.
-quote from movie **Detachment**

What is Ubiquitous assimilation ?(always absorbing, everything, everywhere, all the time) 
(https://youtu.be/ZHSycWF3uU4?si=wjLrcBz3SKfHdp36)

We are always consciously or unconsciously practicing Ubiquitous assimilation, So then
How are you to imagine anything if the images are always provided for you? Through the screen.

**Doublethink** : To deliberately believe in lies, while knowing they're false. (In essence to believe in two opposing views and thinking both of them are right.) 

Examples of this in everyday life: 
"Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin, famous, fashionable." 
Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, and shamed. 
This is a marketing holocaust. 
Twenty-four hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death.

So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, 
we must learn to read. 
To stimulate our own imagination, 
to cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief systems. 
We all need skills to defend, to preserve our own minds.

# **Ubiquitous assimilation**:  
it mean, absorbing information, experiences, and influences from all around us, constantly and everywhere.

This concept suggests that our senses continuously receive stimuli—both positive and negative—that shape our beliefs and behaviors, often unconsciously.

Therefore it's very important to be a conscious consumer of these influences to cultivate a meaningful mindset.



To apply the concept of ubiquitous assimilation in daily life, consider these strategies:

**Be a Conscious Consumer**: Choose what you read, watch, and whom you spend time with deliberately, avoiding mindless consumption of media and influences that don't align with your values

**Reflect on Experiences:** Regularly assess your experiences and interactions to understand how they shape your beliefs and behaviors, filtering out negative influences.

**Cultivate Individuality:** Engage in activities that stimulate your imagination and creativity, such as reading diverse literature or exploring new ideas, to resist societal pressures

By being mindful, you can transform how you assimilate information and experiences












==I now myself live, in every detail, striving for wisdom, while I formerly merely worshipped and idolized the wise==
-Nietzsche 

He who fights with monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.
-Nietzsche(Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism)

The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently
-Nietzsche


==Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life==(so Start making art in your work, your life, your whole being)
-Nietzsche


In the mountains of truth you will never climb in vain: either you will get up higher today or you will exercise your strength so as to be able to get up higher tomorrow.
-Nietzsche



Underneath this reality in which we live and have our being, another and altogether different reality lies concealed
-Nietzsche


No one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but you yourself alone
-Nietzsche


Humans take greater delight in the quest for truth than in the truth itself.
-Gotthold Ephraim Lessing




Philological considerations have slowly but surely taken the place of profound explorations of eternal problems. The question becomes: What did this or that philosopher think or not think? And is this or that text rightly ascribed to him or not? And even: Is this variant of a classical text preferable to that other? Students in university seminars today are encouraged to occupy themselves with such emasculated inquiries. As a result, of course, philosophy itself is banished from the university altogether.
Not one of these nobly equipped young men has escaped the restless, exhausting, confusing, debilitating crisis of education. ... He feels that he cannot guide himself, cannot help himself—and then he dives hopelessly into the world of everyday life and daily routine, he is immersed in the most trivial activity possible, and his limbs grow weak and weary.
-Nietzsche 



**Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing**

That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened.
-Nietzsche 




The constant fluttering around the single flame of vanity is so much the rule and the law that almost nothing is more incomprehensible than ==how an honest and pure urge for truth could make its appearance among men==.
-Nietzsche 

We believe that we know something about the things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things — metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities.
-Nietzsche 


Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions — they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.
-Nietzsche 



Everything which distinguishes man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize perceptual metaphors in a schema, and thus to dissolve an image into a concept.
-Nietzsche 



When someone hides something behind a bush and looks for it again in the same place and finds it there as well, there is not much to praise in such seeking and finding. Yet this is how matters stand regarding seeking and finding "truth" within the realm of reason. If I make up the definition of a mammal, and then, after inspecting a camel, declare "look, a mammal' I have indeed brought a truth to light in this way, but it is a truth of limited value.

*That is to say, it is a thoroughly anthropomorphic truth which contains not a single point which would be "true in itself" or really and universally valid apart from man. At bottom, what the investigator of such truths is seeking is only the metamorphosis of the world into man.*
-Nietzsche 







The man who does not wish to belong to the mass needs only to cease taking himself easily; let him follow his conscience, which calls to him: “Be your self! All you are now doing, thinking, desiring, is not you yourself.”



There exists no more repulsive and desolate creature in the world than the man who has evaded his genius and who now looks furtively to left and right, behind him and all about him. In the end such a man becomes impossible to get hold of, since he is wholly exterior, without kernel: a tattered, painted bag of clothes; a decked-out ghost that cannot inspire even fear and certainly not pity.
-Nietzsche 




We are responsible to ourselves for our own existence; consequently we want to be the true helmsman of this existence and refuse to allow our existence to resemble a mindless act of chance.
-Nietzsche 


Our destiny exercises its influence over us even when, as yet, we have not learned its nature: it is our future that lays down the law of our today.
-Nietzsche 



Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.
-Nietzsche 



***Many a man fails to become a thinker only because his memory is too good***.
-Nietzsche 
(Explanation:- When individuals rely heavily on their memories, they may stick to established facts and past experiences rather than exploring new ideas or questioning what they know. This reliance can limit creativity and critical thinking, as they may not feel the need to analyze or rethink information, leading to a lack of original thought. In essence, a strong memory can create a comfort zone that prevents deeper intellectual engagement)




Young people love what is interesting and odd, no matter how true or false it is. More mature minds love what is interesting and odd about truth. Fully mature intellects, finally, love truth, even when it appears plain and simple, boring to the ordinary person; for they have noticed that truth tends to reveal its highest wisdom in the guise of simplicity.
-Nietzsche 





It is not the struggle of opinions that has made history so violent, but rather the struggle of belief in opinions, that is, the struggle of convictions
-Nietzsche 



Destination and paths. Many people are obstinate about the path once it is taken, few people about the destination.
-Nietzsche 




If you crush a cockroach, you're a hero. If you crush a beautiful butterfly, you're a villain. Morals have aesthetic criteria.
-Nietzsche 




The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.
-Nietzsche 



One must pay dearly for immortality; one has to die several times while one is still alive.
-Nietzsche 


The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.
-nietzsche 


Whatever has value in our world now does not have value in itself, according to its nature — nature is always value-less, but has been given value at some time, as a present — and it was we who gave and bestowed it
-Nietzsche 



You prepare for war in times of peace.
