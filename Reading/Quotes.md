We have such a responsibility to guide our young so that they don't end up falling apart, falling by the wayside, becoming insignificant.
-quote from movie **Detachment** 



Decipline outshines motivation every time.




What is Ubiquitous assimilation ?(always absorbing, everything, everywhere, all the time) 
(https://youtu.be/ZHSycWF3uU4?si=wjLrcBz3SKfHdp36)

We are always consciously or unconsciously practicing Ubiquitous assimilation, So then
How are you to imagine anything if the images are always provided for you? Through the screen.

**Doublethink** : To deliberately believe in lies, while knowing they're false. (In essence to believe in two opposing views and thinking both of them are right.) 

Examples of this in everyday life: 
"Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin, famous, fashionable." 
Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, and shamed. 
This is a marketing holocaust. 
Twenty-four hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death.

So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, 
we must learn to read. 
To stimulate our own imagination, 
to cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief systems. 
We all need skills to defend, to preserve our own minds.

# **Ubiquitous assimilation**:  
it mean, absorbing information, experiences, and influences from all around us, constantly and everywhere.

This concept suggests that our senses continuously receive stimuli—both positive and negative—that shape our beliefs and behaviors, often unconsciously.

Therefore it's very important to be a conscious consumer of these influences to cultivate a meaningful mindset.



To apply the concept of ubiquitous assimilation in daily life, consider these strategies:

**Be a Conscious Consumer**: Choose what you read, watch, and whom you spend time with deliberately, avoiding mindless consumption of media and influences that don't align with your values

**Reflect on Experiences:** Regularly assess your experiences and interactions to understand how they shape your beliefs and behaviors, filtering out negative influences.

**Cultivate Individuality:** Engage in activities that stimulate your imagination and creativity, such as reading diverse literature or exploring new ideas, to resist societal pressures

By being mindful, you can transform how you assimilate information and experiences

He who fights with monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.
-Nietzsche(Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism)

The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently
