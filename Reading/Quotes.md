We have such a responsibility to guide our young so that they don't end up falling apart, falling by the wayside, becoming insignificant.

What is Ubiquitous assimilation ?(always absorbing, everything, everywhere, all the time) 
(https://youtu.be/ZHSycWF3uU4?si=wjLrcBz3SKfHdp36)

We are always consciously or unconsciously practicing Ubiquitous assimilation, So then
How are you to imagine anything if the images are always provided for you? Through the screen.

**Doublethink** : To deliberately believe in lies, while knowing they're false. (In essence to believe in two opposing views and thinking both of them are right.) 

Examples of this in everyday life: 
"Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin, famous, fashionable." 
Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, and shamed. 
This is a marketing holocaust. 
Twenty-four hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death.

So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, 
we must learn to read. 
To stimulate our own imagination, 
to cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief systems. 
We all need skills to defend, to preserve our own minds.

# **Ubiquitous assimilation**:  
it mean, absorbing information, experiences, and influences from all around us, constantly and everywhere.

This concept suggests that our senses continuously receive stimuli—both positive and negative—that shape our beliefs and behaviors, often unconsciously.

Therefore it's very important to be a conscious consumer of these influences to cultivate a meaningful mindset.



To apply the concept of ubiquitous assimilation in daily life, consider these strategies:

**Be a Conscious Consumer**: Choose what you read, watch, and whom you spend time with deliberately, avoiding mindless consumption of media and influences that don't align with your values

**Reflect on Experiences:** Regularly assess your experiences and interactions to understand how they shape your beliefs and behaviors, filtering out negative influences.

**Cultivate Individuality:** Engage in activities that stimulate your imagination and creativity, such as reading diverse literature or exploring new ideas, to resist societal pressures

By being mindful, you can transform how you assimilate information and experiences


==I now myself live, in every detail, striving for wisdom, while I formerly merely worshipped and idolized the wise==
-Nietzsche 

He who fights with monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.
-Nietzsche(Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism)

The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently
-Nietzsche


==Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life==(so Start making art in your work, your life, your whole being)
-Nietzsche


In the mountains of truth you will never climb in vain: either you will get up higher today or you will exercise your strength so as to be able to get up higher tomorrow.
-Nietzsche



Underneath this reality in which we live and have our being, another and altogether different reality lies concealed
-Nietzsche


No one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but you yourself alone
-Nietzsche


Humans take greater delight in the quest for truth than in the truth itself.
-Gotthold Ephraim Lessing




Philological considerations have slowly but surely taken the place of profound explorations of eternal problems. The question becomes: What did this or that philosopher think or not think? And is this or that text rightly ascribed to him or not? And even: Is this variant of a classical text preferable to that other? Students in university seminars today are encouraged to occupy themselves with such emasculated inquiries. As a result, of course, philosophy itself is banished from the university altogether.
Not one of these nobly equipped young men has escaped the restless, exhausting, confusing, debilitating crisis of education. ... He feels that he cannot guide himself, cannot help himself—and then he dives hopelessly into the world of everyday life and daily routine, he is immersed in the most trivial activity possible, and his limbs grow weak and weary.
-Nietzsche 



**Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing**

That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened.
-Nietzsche
