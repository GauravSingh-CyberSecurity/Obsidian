1) **Define your values** from those of what society has chosen for you, understand if it's the dust on the mirror or my actual reflection .
Sit with yourself every day for 15-20 min and do a self evaluation on how did my day went how I feel about the way I spent it , with people whom I spent it with 

Do an evaluation to define your values.
Write down all of your values and determine if they are really something you value or is it something the OEO(opinion, expectation, obligation) of society.

And clearly define your actual values that you prioritize, then decide the people who have some of these common values and decide to spend time with these people who actually make you feel fulfilled and happy inside when you are with them.

Identify the people who make you irritated and negative when you are with them and filter them out.

Filter out the values that doesn't align with you for you to become who you want to be.

My values: is it really me 



2) negative thoughts are like a mosquito even a single one in the mosquito net can fuck you up 
- Stop | spot | swap (this is how you process negative thoughts observe , reflect,devlop)
- do this exercise using above SSS, try to minimise your negative thoughts of CCC(complain, compare, criticize )
- eg:- you spot an emotion of envy against your friend, now understand that is you are envious of that person, if what they have would be taken away from them but you won't get it would it make you happy, No! Then this is a negative emotion that you can stop now .
And be happy for them.





3) Fear: Fear does not prevent death, it prevents life.
- Anxiety is every day fear

There are 2 types of fear:
  1) mortal/terminal Fear
  2) everyday Fear / Anxiety 
The fear of mortality is good it helps us survive but you don't face this every day.
The every day fear is called anxiety it stops us from moving forward and doing something because we get too afraid to fail.

We must find what is it that we fear , think of it as a branch of a tree now try to find root of this fear, and before you even find the root you will first find a lots of branch you must push through it , and push deeper to find the root cause.

If you have anxiety (every day fear) of something/some work etc. Practice that work or action so much that the fear becomes lesser and lesser till it becomes insignificant 

Differentiate between real mortal fear and imaginary fear.

Our reaction to fear: panic , freeze, run away, or we bury it

Use your fear productivity.

Audit your fear : write down everything you are afraid to loose both internal and external.

The work towards getting detached with all these things, and still be able to enjoy them.
Eg: like an Airbnb luxurious hotel that you got to live in for just a week.

4) Happiness: not an external gratification (only when you achieve some external success or growth )
- Happiness is an internal factor that happens when you connect with your mind and soul


- **Building competence but not the character that is narcissistic**
- **Building character but not the competence that is devoid**



Every day Routine:-

 
 - **TIME** :- Thankful, intenstion, meditation, exercise 
- To walk down the same old path and find a new stone is to open your mind.
Try to be open to new things pay attention.
You forgetting things is not a retention problem but an attention problem.

5) Mind: our mind have around 70000 thoughts every day and we usually spend around 3 seconds on a single state of mind or thought.
To understand your own self you must try and reflect on as many of the relevant thoughts possible.

As irrigators lead water where they want, as archers make their arrows straight, as carpenters carve wood, the wise shape their minds.

-Gautama Buddha



The man who conquers his mind is his own best friend; but he who fails to do so remains his own greatest enemy.
-Bhagwat Gita



Positive self talk 

**Detachment** : detachment doesn't means I own nothing, it means nothing owns me.
That is even while being close to everything, nothing controls me.

**Ego** : your ego wants to show you as a better, more experienced and intelligent person in front of the world.

While **detachment** and **humility** 
Helps you actually be a better person for your self.
