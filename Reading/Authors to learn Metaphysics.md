Why: Kant’s influence is important in Peterson’s thinking on ethics, morality, and the limits of human knowledge.

Why These Authors Matter to Peterson:

Psychology: Many of these authors are foundational in psychology (Jung, Piaget, Rogers), and Peterson’s own work draws heavily from these traditions.

Philosophy & Ethics: Peterson frequently references philosophers like Nietzsche, Kant, and Hume for their exploration of morality, meaning, and human nature.

Political & Social Thought: Writers like Orwell, Solzhenitsyn, and Marx (though Peterson critiques Marx) engage with power structures, which ties into Peterson’s frequent commentary on political ideologies and their impacts on society.


Peterson’s reading list focuses on deep, often challenging texts that explore the nature of the self, the structure of society, and the human condition. While not all of these writers align with Peterson's personal views, he believes engaging with their ideas is essential for developing a more nuanced understanding of life and the world.
