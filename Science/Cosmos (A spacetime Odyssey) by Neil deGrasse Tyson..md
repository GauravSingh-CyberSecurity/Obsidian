Our address in the universe

Earth

Solar system 

Milky Way galaxy 

Local group (50 galaxy , eg :Andromeda etc..)

Virgo cluster (thousands of galaxy )

Observable universe (approx 200 billion galaxy )




If we compress age of our universe.    (13. 8 billion years) in
1 year (i.e jan-dec / cosmic calander)
PS: 429 years = 1 second 

Humanity came into existence on 

31 Dec  at 9:45 pm.    
And considering today will be 12:00 am of 1st jan


31 Dec at 11:59:46 pm is the oldest history ever been recorded of humans/civilization (i.e all of recorded history ever by human's)

That means on a cosmic calendar we have only 14 seconds of record history 

And at 31 Dec at 11:59:00 pm (60 sec ago) humans painted first pictures 

14 seconds ago wrote first scriptures (6000 human years)

That means everything thing we know every story was made in these 14 seconds 

And at 31 DEC 11:59:59 (1 sec ago) human's started to learn and use science (eg: Galileo galeli )
