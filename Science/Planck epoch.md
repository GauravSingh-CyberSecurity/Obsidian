Planck epoch
It means when big bang happened,

The time from big bang i.e 0 to the time that light first came into existence and photons of light traveled in space

Basically when light started travelling the physics came into existence
But before the light, before the physics.
There was a time


That is 10^-43(ten to the power minus forty three sec)


 Means between bigbang I.e 0 and 10^-43 sec i.e planck epoch , there was no time no physics no reality that we know today

And and , let me put Planck epoch in perspective for you.

Imagine 1 sec as big as a universe in size 
10^-43 is then like a proton

Now this begs the question, ki if in Planck epoch time didn't existed in the form it exists today, and time didn't flow the same that it does in our physical reality.

Then it is possible that, what we perceive as such a small blip of time according to our physical reality.

May have been as long as whole lifetime of a universe in some other physical dominion
