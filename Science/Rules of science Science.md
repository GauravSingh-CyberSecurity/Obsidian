1. **Finding Truth is difficult and the road to it is rough.**
2. **As seekers of the truth, you will be wise to withhold judgement and not simply put your trust in the writings of the ancients.**
3. **You must question and critically examine those writings from every side.**  
4. **You must submit to only argument and experiment and not to the sayings of any person. For every human being is vulnerable to all kinds of imperfections.**
