# Transcript :

1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,850
The last thing we're going to cover for this course is going to be additional resources.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,970
I want to walk you through some free resources as well as some paid resources where you can practice

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,670
and learn more before this video recovered activity.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,120
And Hacker one's hacker one on one website.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,290
We're going to talk about this also again, but I want to make sure I highlight a few other ones to

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,720
make sure you have enough resources to go through your background, your journey.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,510
But before we jump into that, just keep in mind that this horse is going to get regularly updated.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm going to add more resources and more videos, more chapters, more topics into this course.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,540
If you see something's missing, let me know.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,000
I would love to cover it, but I do have plans on updating this course and adding more and more to it

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,080
every few months.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,200
Let's jump into the resources and have a look.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,310
If you head over to Nahum Secombe and see a few of these resources, the first one being Twitch.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,540
If you want to come hang out with me on Twitch, I go live about three or four times a week.

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,030
I talk about Rickon, I do some mentorship.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,180
I bring on top hackers and I interview them and we have some fun with Tri Hack Me boxes where I learn

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,840
new skills.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,660
You can also watch a lot of these on YouTube and I also post videos of my day to day life, some random

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,160
research I've done and so on.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,310
This score is a great place to get a hold of me and other like bounty hunters.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,190
If you want to come and talk to some other bug bounty hunters, find somebody to collaborate with.

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,790
Go ahead.

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,030
And on this Dischord link, again, it's all on my website.

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,350
And you can connect to all three of these channels by just going to our website, Nozick dot com.

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,440
And the last thing I want to talk about is the bug bounty resources.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,200
Let's start off with the free resources.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,660
One of my favorite ones to use as hacker one or one.

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,640
We cover this in an early video.

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,700
This is a great place to go and practice your new skills.

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,100
It also gives you access to private invites.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
I mean, you get an invite to a private program that not everybody has access to and you get to hack

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,190
on it with an exclusive club of people and it reduces your chances of duplicates.

33
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,980
But it's also cool that you get more invites by just hacking on sites while you learn and practice your

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,400
skills.

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,120
The next one we're going to look at as the website Academi.

36
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,130
So I'm going to quickly put it up on the screen.

37
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,920
This is my post Flickr, the same folks behind BuzzFeed, and this is also a very good place to learn.

38
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,960
Revisit some of the stuff that we have talked about.

39
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,460
If you're confident that you understand crosshatch scripting, you can just dive into their labs and

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,220
see if you can identify the vulnerabilities that I've given you.

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,840
But also, if you need additional resources to understand some of these concepts, you can also go to

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,400
their articles, read them, and then later on do their jobs.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,780
I highly recommend going through some of these, especially if you need the bug bounty hunting and just

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,040
clicking on some of these topics and going through their lives and making sure you understand them all.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,800
The next one that we're going to look at is called a damn vulnerable web out.

46
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,470
This is an open source project.

47
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,350
All you have to do is download it, set it up on your end.

48
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,410
And this is a vulnerable web by design where you can actually click on different topics like file upload,

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,240
it's a good capture exercise, SQL injection and also get some other practices.

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,480
And again, this is additional to the lives and the challenges that I've created for this cause.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,810
If you are looking for more stuff, TBWA is a really good place.

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,500
There's also juice shot by a WASP, which is also a very good resource to practice all of your newly

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,340
acquired skills.

54
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,330
Same concept.

55
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,710
It's a fake juice shop.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,810
You can practice different vulnerability types and have made this vulnerable by default for you to find

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,940
these ones and look for him in know out.

58
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,470
Both of them are really, really good.

59
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,820
I highly recommend looking at them both and seeing if you can identify bugs on the fly using the skills

60
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,750
I have picked up from this course as well.

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,710
The next two responses we're going to look out are not free, but I highly recommend them.

62
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,220
If you have a little bit of extra cash pen tester, that is a really, really good one.

63
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,130
It cost about twenty to thirty dollars.

64
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,350
It looks like it's twenty dollars actually a month.

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,170
You can also buy a yearly subscription for 200 dollars.

66
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,600
There are some free modules, but again, a lot of the better material is on their subscription.

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,670
But this also helps you practice some of these exercises and you can look at the different categories.

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:05,790
They go anywhere from intermediate to pro now Rickon, Thavasi, Samal, OAuth and all the different

69
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,690
ones code review.

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,710
So if you want to get extra practice and you have a little bit of money, this is another one that I

71
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,090
highly recommend looking into.

72
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,920
They're really, really good at last.

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,450
But not least before I jump into the last portion of this course, the very last thing I'm going to

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,190
talk about this.

75
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,220
Look at the bug hunter, bug bounty hunter, bug bounty hunter, dotcom.

76
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,320
This is a very good resource as well, created by Zeshan.

77
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,280
This has a free version, I believe, where you can do some of these different levels.

78
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,740
But the majority of it is also paid.

79
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,570
And I think this is about twenty dollars.

80
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,010
It also gives you access to the SeÃ±ores own methodology.

81
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,980
And he kind of gives you an idea of how easy Shonna himself is approaching his targets and how he does

82
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,670
his bug hunting.

83
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,600
This is another one.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,920
Again, this does cost some money, but if you have a little bit of extra cash and you want to invest

85
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,910
more into your learning and also use some of these challenges again.

86
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,720
Some of these are free, you can do them without any payment, but these Chandos on methodology cost

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,370
a little bit of money, but I highly recommend it as well.

88
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,520
And the last thing I want to highlight is looking at the challenges and the infrastructure that we've

89
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,480
put up for this course.

90
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,070
Earlier, when we were doing the slides, we had those challenges on the job training.

91
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,230
Those should be available to you for free.

92
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,100
You can always go to the that training and play with them.

93
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,600
If the website does go down, I'll make sure to update you, demand that you download it on your own

94
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,690
and be able to install it and use it on your own to learn more and kind of understand these topics in

95
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,110
depth.

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,660
The second thing is, as you saw that the store dot com website that's also going to be live, you can't

97
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,410
use it going to the house or dot com.

98
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,070
However, if you go sign up for a try, hock me.

99
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,350
And I also managed to put a link into the resources.

100
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,890
If you go sign up for try me, try again.

101
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,020
It's a great resource to learn about hacking.

102
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,520
I have a ton of different paths.

103
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,690
You can also do it for free.

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,830
You have some premium stuff that you have to pay for.

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,170
But the content of this course, including the new home store infrastructure that I've demoed and some

106
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,500
other videos it's going to be available on, try hock me for free.

107
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,450
All you have to do is click on the link in the description, sign up and there's going to be an invite

108
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,210
only link available for it exclusively for discourse until we publish it later on for the entire global

109
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,410
trischka community.

110
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,810
So for now, do me a favor.

111
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,600
Sign up.

112
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,020
Absolutely.

113
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,350
For free.

114
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,370
You don't have to pay anything.

115
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,530
You don't have to upgrade and then click on the invite link to join the room that is dedicated to this

116
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:27,890
cause.

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,040
And it's going to ask you questions like where is the exercise finder using RC?

118
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,100
There's a ton of different questions we're going to ask you to in order to make sure you understand

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,310
the concepts of this course and you get an actual lab to practice on and make sure you fully grasp everything

120
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,070
you have learned with this bug hunting course.

121
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,270
And again, if any questions come up, come talk to me on this score.

122
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,210
I'm on Twitter.

123
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,530
I'm on almost all social media under Nahoum said, look me up, send me a message.

124
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,370
Anything I can help you.

125
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,180
Send me a tweet.

126
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,130
D.M. Whatever works, I would love to hear from you and get some feedback about the course and maybe

127
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,190
some other topics that you would like to see on the next update.
