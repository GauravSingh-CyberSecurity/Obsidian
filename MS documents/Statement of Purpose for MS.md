For the record I am starting to write this SOP on 2:15 AM- 12-july-2025 on a Friday night, well technically Saturday morning.

As a 15 year old kid in 10th standard, I used to watch movies and read books about all over the world but one place got my keen attention, one city that I have never been to, never seen physically only viewed in media, movies, books and internet.
Felt like home, felt like a place I want to live in, felt like a place where my soul belongs it was intuition something coming from beyond my control. I could only imagine that life when I was 15 year old kid, couldn't see any paths to actually travel to that destination, just a daydream.

I strongly believe this life in itself doesn't have a purpose, it is humans who create purpose, give meaning to our lives.

Same thing happened with me , this intuition and sense of belonging to a city was not very practical in real world so I put that daydream on pause whenever I had to live in the real world but every now and then I would retreat back to that dream.

Years passed by the boy who was captain of the football team inherently not very interested in academics, slowly started to develop this ambition to gain knowledge that must lead him to achieve wisdom and thereafter peace. 
I got good at academics and was topper in my Diploma in Mechanical engineering,
Suddenly Corona and lockdown hit, everything came to a sudden halt, but the online world remained intact and people were still connected with loved ones, I realised that this probably never happened in past , where if a pandemic ever hits the world this hard and people social lives weren't shattered to bits, but the internet and online social media platform helped us keep our Social lives intact a reasonable extent considering that whole world was under a species wiping level threat.

This got my interest in Computers, internet, computer sciences .
I started self studying from the world of computers from all angles, technical, historical, philosophical, humanities, psychological, Scientific, AI's , Sci-fi , biographies of Pioneers of the sciences of computational world, Quantum computation world , studied about people who theorized these fields, who practically implemented the like Allen turing, Einstein, Steve jobs, Newtown, tesla and many more and understood how all those different theorists and creators helped build the computer world we have today. I even studied about the word computer and where it comes from, for the record first computers were a group of women who used to manually perform calculation at Harvard for Edward pickering who was a physicist .
Kind of ironic that these days women are becoming less and less intrested in Computers and its science.

Anyways after my self research and studies I developed a very deep intrest in science and tech , at this point in my life I found myself to be wanting to pick one of the two: pursue a carrier in computer science or pursue a carrier in theoretical physics.

My interest was more leaning towards computer science so I decided to pursue a degree in computer science, now even in computer science when I delved deeper I found many allied branches for computer science, like AI, Data science and Cybersecurity.

I got intrested in Cybersecurity, probably because even in my childhood I was fascinated by the Hackers and thought the things they could do were very cool .
And that childhood Gaurav's intrest in hacking and this adult Gaurav's intrest in computers and sciences , and that curiosity to understand how all the things work the whole universe, the whole world, the whole computer systems led me to choose Cybersecurity.
Specifically Offensive Security or what you may sa Red teaming as well.

Because I loved to learn practically how computer systems exactly work and then it becomes very simple to hack and exploit them when you know how they work, And then I found out this skill even pays good money.

So after completing my bachelor's of engineering for Computer science in Cybersecurity; I started working full-time in the Cyber Security as an ethical hacker and bug bounty hunter.

Along side this academic development of my self, I carried the dream of living in newyork in my heart. And slowly all the things started falling in place and I found myself able to envision a pathway to fulfill this dream too.

I created a roadmap on how I can pursue my Master's degree in Newyork itself and fullfill Two ambition at once,
First is wanting to live in New York and second is learning and developing my skill in Cybersecurity to fulfill my curiosity even more and rise up to the next level and eventually to play in big leagues of Cyber Security in the big city.

And this is the purpose I created for my carrier to give meaning to it, 
And this is my Statement of purpose and as for the part of my technical capabilities you can see my profile and portfolio to verify if I am up to your mark .


To be continued... Or Update and abridge.

üìù Statement of Purpose ‚Äì Gaurav Singh

Ever since I was fifteen, one city has captivated my imagination like no other ‚Äî New York. I had never visited it, only experienced its soul through books, films, and the digital world. Yet, even as a schoolboy in India, I felt a deep, intuitive connection to the city ‚Äî a sense of belonging I couldn‚Äôt logically explain. At the time, it seemed like a distant dream. But over the years, that dream evolved into purpose. Now, as a cybersecurity professional with a vision to grow both personally and professionally, I am ready to pursue a Master's degree in New York ‚Äî a city that aligns with both my ambitions and identity.

My academic journey began in Mechanical Engineering, where I graduated as the diploma program topper. But during the COVID-19 lockdown, as the physical world paused, I became increasingly fascinated by the resilience of the digital world. Despite global isolation, people remained connected ‚Äî thanks to the internet and computing systems. This moment sparked a profound curiosity in me: How do these systems work, and how can they be protected? This introspection shifted my focus entirely towards computer science, and later, cybersecurity.

I embarked on a rigorous journey of self-learning. I studied computer history, the evolution of the internet, and the philosophies of pioneers like Alan Turing, Tesla, and Steve Jobs. I even explored the origins of the term ‚Äúcomputer,‚Äù discovering that it once referred to women who performed manual calculations at Harvard under Edward Charles Pickering. My research ranged from quantum computing to artificial intelligence and eventually led me to one specialization that felt like a calling ‚Äî cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity offered everything I was drawn to: deep technical learning, real-world application, intellectual challenge, and most of all, ethical impact. Among its branches, offensive security stood out. Understanding a system inside-out to ethically break and defend it combined the analytical depth of science with the creative freedom of exploration. My childhood fascination with hackers transformed into a career aspiration: to become a Red Teamer capable of defending digital infrastructure at scale.

I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity. During and after college, I immersed myself in the field ‚Äî participating in ethical hacking, bug bounty programs, Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, and real-world VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing). I earned certifications like Hack The Box‚Äôs CBBH and am currently preparing for the OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert) to deepen my offensive security expertise. Professionally, I‚Äôve worked on security testing projects for enterprise applications, conducted real incident response investigations (like SEO poisoning and web shell attacks), and developed custom Python scripts to automate vulnerability discovery.

Alongside this technical growth, my vision of studying in New York has matured from fantasy into a structured goal. I have carefully planned to align my academic and career path with the city‚Äôs thriving tech ecosystem. New York is home to some of the most prominent cybersecurity firms, financial institutions, and innovation hubs ‚Äî making it the ideal environment for me to grow into a next-generation security engineer.

A Master's degree from your institution will allow me to specialize in advanced areas such as red teaming, threat detection, malware analysis, or cloud security, under expert faculty mentorship. I am particularly drawn to your hands-on approach, research labs, and industry-integrated curriculum. I hope to contribute through research, internships, and peer collaboration, bringing with me not only technical skills but also the deep self-motivation, curiosity, and passion that have driven me so far.

Ultimately, my goal is to work in New York as a cybersecurity specialist at the frontlines of digital defense ‚Äî helping organizations secure their systems while continuing to grow as a practitioner and lifelong learner.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Gaurav Singh
