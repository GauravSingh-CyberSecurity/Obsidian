For the record I am starting to write this SOP on 2:15 AM- 12-july-2025 on a Friday night, well technically Saturday morning.

As a 15 year old kid in 10th standard, I used to watch movies and read books about all over the world but one place got my keen attention, one city that I have never been to, never seen physically only viewed in media, movies, books and internet.
Felt like home, felt like a place I want to live in, felt like a place where my soul belongs it was intuition something coming from beyond my control. I could only imagine that life when I was 15 year old kid, couldn't see any paths to actually travel to that destination, just a daydream.

I strongly believe this life in itself doesn't have a purpose, it is humans who create purpose, give meaning to our lives.

Same thing happened with me , this intuition and sense of belonging to a city was not very practical in real world so I put that daydream on pause whenever I had to live in the real world but every now and then I would retreat back to that dream.

Years passed by the boy who was captain of the football team inherently not very interested in academics, slowly started to develop this ambition to gain knowledge that must lead him to achieve wisdom and thereafter peace. 
I got good at academics and was topper in my Diploma in Mechanical engineering,
Suddenly Corona and lockdown hit, everything came to a sudden halt, but the online world remained intact and people were still connected with loved ones, I realised that this probably never happened in past , where if a pandemic ever hits the world this hard and people social lives weren't shattered to bits, but the internet and online social media platform helped us keep our Social lives intact a reasonable extent considering that whole world was under a species wiping level threat.

This got my interest in Computers, internet, computer sciences .
I started self studying from the world of computers from all angles, technical, historical, philosophical, humanities, psychological, Scientific, AI's , Sci-fi , biographies of Pioneers of the sciences of computational world, Quantum computation world , studied about people who theorized these fields, who practically implemented the like Allen turing, Einstein, Steve jobs, Newtown, tesla and many more and understood how all those different theorists and creators helped build the computer world we have today. I even studied about the word computer and where it comes from, for the record first computers were a group of women who used to manually perform calculation at Harvard for Edward pickering who was a physicist .
Kind of ironic that these days women are becoming less and less intrested in Computers and its science.

Anyways after my self research and studies I developed a very deep intrest in science and tech , at this point in my life I found myself to be wanting to pick one of the two: pursue a carrier in computer science or pursue a carrier in theoretical physics.

My interest was more leaning towards computer science so I decided to pursue a degree in computer science, now even in computer science when I delved deeper I found many allied branches for computer science, like AI, Data science and Cybersecurity.

I got intrested in Cybersecurity, probably because even in my childhood I was fascinated by the Hackers and thought the things they could do were very cool .
And that childhood Gaurav's intrest in hacking and this adult Gaurav's intrest in computers and sciences , and that curiosity to understand how all the things work the whole universe, the whole world, the whole computer systems led me to choose Cybersecurity.
Specifically Offensive Security or what you may sa Red teaming as well.

Because I loved to learn practically how computer systems exactly work and then it becomes very simple to hack and exploit them when you know how they work, And then I found out this skill even pays good money.

So after completing my bachelor's of engineering for Computer science in Cybersecurity; I started working full-time in the Cyber Security as an ethical hacker and bug bounty hunter.

Along side this academic development of my self, I carried the dream of living in newyork in my heart. And slowly all the things started falling in place and I found myself able to envision a pathway to fulfill this dream too.

I created a roadmap on how I can pursue my Master's degree in Newyork itself and fullfill Two ambition at once,
First is wanting to live in New York and second is learning and developing
