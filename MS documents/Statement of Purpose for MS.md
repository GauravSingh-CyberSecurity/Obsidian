For the record I am starting to write this SOP on 2:15 AM- 12-july-2025 on a Friday night, well technically Saturday morning.

As a 15 year old kid in 10th standard, I used to watch movies and read books about all over the world but one place got my keen attention, one city that I have never been to, never seen physically only viewed in media, movies, books and internet.
Felt like home, felt like a place I want to live in, felt like a place where my soul belongs it was intuition something coming from beyond my control. I could only imagine that life when I was 15 year old kid, couldn't see any paths to actually travel to that destination, just a daydream.

I strongly believe this life in itself doesn't have a purpose, it is humans who create purpose, give meaning to our lives.

Same thing happened with me , this intuition and sense of belonging to a city was not very practical in real world so I put that daydream on pause whenever I had to live in the real world but every now and then I would retreat back to that dream.
