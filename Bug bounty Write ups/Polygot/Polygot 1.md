Drop your fav polyglot

Mine is simple and does not test all contexts but is effective:
```
'"><img src=x>${{7*2}}
```

**Explanation**:

- '" : JS injection
- `'">` : html tag attribute
- `<img src=x>` : brokenimage html injection
- '" : SQLi 
- `${{7*2}}` : CSTI and SSTI

This won't give you an XSS or SQLi ... but it might give you an injection point

Chatgpts reply:-

I like your polyglot — it’s elegant, lightweight, and _very effective for context discovery_. Let's break it down:

---

### 💡 Your Polyglot:

```html
'"><img src=x>${{7*2}}
```

---

### 🧠 **Context & Purpose**:

This payload **does not directly exploit** XSS or SQLi or SSTI, but it’s meant to **test whether an injection is possible and _where_**.

It helps in:

- **Discovering injection points**
- **Breaking out of HTML/JS/SQL contexts**
- **Triggering template engines or rendering behavior**

---

### 🔍 **Component-by-Component Breakdown**:

|Part|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`'`|Breaks out of single-quoted strings (often SQL or HTML attributes)|
|`"`|Breaks out of double-quoted contexts|
|`>`|Closes current HTML tag, opens up for HTML injection|
|`<img src=x>`|Inserts a broken image; useful for visual confirmation in reflected responses|
|`${{7*2}}`|Triggers **SSTI/CSTI** template rendering in engines like Jinja2, Handlebars, AngularJS|

---

### 🔥 Why It Works:

This payload is like a **universal probe**. You’re not trying to exploit — you’re **fishing for feedback**.

If the app:

- **Reflects** it back → test for **XSS**
- **Evaluates `${{7*2}}` as `14`** → **CSTI/SSTI** present
- **Breaks HTML layout** → you may have **HTML injection**
- **Logs or crashes** → **error-based SQLi** or server-side processing

---

### ✅ When to Use:

Use it when:

- You're just starting recon on a form, URL, or header
- You want to quickly determine: _What kind of injection am I dealing with?_
- You want to check server-side rendering behavior

---

### 🧪 Tip for Testing:

Use it with:

- Burp Suite Repeater
- Intercepted parameters in POST/GET
- Custom headers (User-Agent, Referer, etc.)
- HTML forms & URL params

---

### 📌 Bonus – A Slightly Enhanced Version:

```html
'"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>{{7*2}}<svg onload=confirm(1)>
```

> This one actually **executes** basic XSS and still checks SSTI. But your original is better for clean _injection point discovery_.

---

Let me know if you'd like a full set of polyglots for different contexts (XSS, SQLi, SSTI, etc.) or a Burp Intruder wordlist.

'''
Looking at your payload '"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>${{7*2}}, this is a multi-vector attack string that can help identify several vulnerabilities. Here are all the vulnerability headings it can find or indicate:

🔍 Vulnerabilities This Payload Can Detect:
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Reflected XSS
Stored XSS
DOM-based XSS
2. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
Jinja2 Template Injection
Twig Template Injection
Handlebars Template Injection
Smarty Template Injection
Velocity Template Injection
3. Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)
AngularJS Template Injection
Vue.js Template Injection
React Template Injection
4. Input Validation Bypass
HTML Injection
Attribute Injection
Quote Escaping Vulnerabilities
5. Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass
Unsafe-inline Detection
Missing CSP Headers
6. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Bypass
Filter Evasion
Blacklist Bypass
7. Output Encoding Issues
Improper HTML Encoding
Missing Entity Encoding
Context-Specific Encoding Failures
8. Template Engine Vulnerabilities
Expression Language Injection
Template Context Escape
Server-Side Code Execution
9. JavaScript Framework Vulnerabilities
Framework-Specific XSS
Expression Injection
10. Content Type Confusion
MIME Type Sniffing
Content-Type Header Issues
🎯 Payload Breakdown:
'" - Tests quote escaping and attribute injection
><img src=x onerror=alert(1)> - Classic XSS vector
${{7*2}} - Template injection testing (should evaluate to 14 if vulnerable)
This payload is particularly effective because it combines multiple attack vectors in a single string, making it a great reconnaissance tool for identifying various web application vulnerabilities!
