1. Research and Understand the Target
Understand the platform: Familiarize yourself with the social media platform you are targeting. Understand how it works, what technologies it uses, and its typical user flow.

Review the Bug Bounty Program: Visit the bug bounty platform (like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, or others) where the social media platform hosts its program. Read the rules, scope, and guidelines. Know what’s in-scope (what you can test) and out-of-scope (what you cannot test).

Identify any public vulnerabilities: Check the platform’s previous bug bounty reports (publicly disclosed vulnerabilities) to see what kind of issues have been reported. This can give you insight into areas that may have common vulnerabilities.




2. Understand the Scope and Rules
Scope: Identify which domains, subdomains, or features are in scope. The bug bounty program typically lists out the areas you can test (e.g., web app, mobile app, API). Be sure to avoid in-scope areas.

Exclusions: Social media platforms often have exclusions like user profiles, comment sections, and account-level attacks (social engineering). Respect these boundaries to avoid getting disqualified.

Legal and Ethical Guidelines: Make sure you follow ethical guidelines and laws. Do not exploit bugs to cause harm or violate privacy. Your goal is to responsibly report vulnerabilities.




3. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
Gather information about the platform:
Look at the social media site’s frontend (HTML, JS) for hidden endpoints, admin panels, or exposed sensitive information.
Use tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, or OWASP ZAP for scanning and analyzing the platform.
Look for third-party integrations that could be vulnerable (payment systems, login systems, etc.).

Check subdomains: Use subdomain enumeration tools to uncover hidden services or endpoints that may be overlooked.

Check user interaction points: Many vulnerabilities emerge where users interact with the platform—uploading files, entering comments, sending direct messages, etc.





4. Conduct Testing NEVER SPAM ATTACK VECTORS IN A PUBLIC WAY IF YOU CAN AVOID IT!!

Start with Common Vulnerabilities:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Social media platforms often suffer from XSS vulnerabilities. Test user input fields such as post creation, comments, messaging, etc.
SQL Injection: Although less common with modern platforms, certain parts of the app (like user login forms or search fields) may be vulnerable.
Authentication Issues: Test for flaws in the login flow, password recovery, or session management

Access Control Issues: Check if users can access content they shouldn’t be able to (e.g., viewing private posts, private profiles).

API Vulnerabilities: Many social media platforms expose APIs. Test for insecure endpoints, data leakage, or incorrect permission settings.

Rate-Limiting: Check if the platform has appropriate rate-limiting measures to prevent abuse (e.g., account enumeration via login attempts).






5. Document Findings and Report Responsibly

Provide a detailed report: When you find a vulnerability, document it thoroughly:
Reproduce the issue: Clearly explain how the bug can be replicated step by step.
Provide Evidence: Include screenshots, videos, or logs to substantiate your findings.
Impact Assessment: Explain the potential impact of the vulnerability. Is it a low-severity issue like a minor XSS, or something that could allow account takeover or data leaks?

Follow Program Reporting Guidelines: Some platforms have a specific way they want vulnerabilities reported (e.g., through a bug bounty platform, via email). Follow the format and guidelines.

Suggest Mitigations: If possible, suggest remediation steps to fix the bug. This shows you are helpful and invested in improving the security of the platform.




6. Engage with the Program Team

Be Professional: Always maintain a professional tone when interacting with the program's security team. Understand that they are busy, and appreciate their efforts.

Collaborate: If they ask for clarification, be ready to help them reproduce the issue or answer questions.

Respect timelines: Give the platform enough time to patch the vulnerability before publicly disclosing it. Bug bounty platforms usually specify timelines for responsible disclosure.




7. Stay Updated on New Developments

Monitor the Bug Bounty Program: Keep an eye on changes to the program (updates to the scope or exclusions). This can help you target new areas or understand shifts in security priorities.

Patch and Re-test: After discovering an issue, follow up after the patch is implemented to ensure that it’s fixed and that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
