1. Create Multiple Accounts Use at least 2 test users (e.g., UserA and UserB). Perform actions like posting, sending messages, uploading photos with UserA. 

2. Capture Requests Use Burp Suite or a proxy. Look for API or web requests containing object IDs: /post/123 /user/456/avatar /message/7890 

3. Try Cross-Account Access Replay UserA’s request as UserB: Can UserB read, edit, or delete UserA’s content? Modify: Object ID (swap IDs) UUIDs if used Parameters like user_id, post_id, message_id 

4. Verify the Actual Effect ✅ Don’t trust a 200 OK! Check: Did the backend return someone else’s data? Was a change actually saved or applied? 5. Stay Safe Never test on real user data. Avoid destructive actions unless allowed. Use only your own test accounts.
