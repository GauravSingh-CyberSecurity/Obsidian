- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- Broken Access Control (functional)
- Broken Access Control (object/property level)
- Rate-limiting bypass
- Weak password policy exploitation

- SSRF (no authentication)
- Parameter pollution
- Cookie manipulation
- CSRF (state-changing requests)
- CSRF token bypass techniques

- SQLi (error-based)
- SQLi (blind boolean/time)
- GraphQL introspection leaks
- WebSocket hijacking
- Chaining SSRF → RCE
- Second-order SQLi

- SAML misconfigurations (signature stripping)
- Advanced SQLi in JSON / XML
- RCE through file parsing libraries
- Blind SSRF → cloud metadata abuse → pivot
- Deserialization exploits (PHP/Java/.NET)
- Template injection → sandbox escape
