OSCP: The Red Team Rite of Passage 🎯

The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification isn’t just a milestone—it’s a mindset shift. This guide is packed with field-tested tactics, enumeration flowcharts, exploitation techniques, and privilege escalation paths every red teamer needs to pass the exam—and win real-world engagements.

🔥 What’s Inside the OSCP Playbook

1️⃣ Enumeration Flow Like a Pro
	•	Use nmap, gobuster, nikto, and enum4linux in a structured recon chain.
	•	Enumerate services and identify weak entry points before touching Metasploit.

2️⃣ Web & Service Exploitation
	•	Manual SQLi, XSS, and file upload abuse.
	•	Exploit RCEs, LFI, and CVEs with proof-of-concept tailoring.

3️⃣ Linux Privilege Escalation
	•	SUID/GUID hunting:

find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

	•	Misconfigured cron jobs and writable scripts = root.

4️⃣ Windows Privilege Escalation
	•	Use winPEAS, PowerUp, and DLL hijacking to elevate.
	•	Don’t forget Unquoted Service Paths and AlwaysInstallElevated abuses.

5️⃣ Buffer Overflows
	•	Custom exploit writing from fuzzing to shell execution.
	•	Practice using Immunity Debugger, Mona.py, and pattern_create/offset.

6️⃣ Post-Exploitation & Reporting
	•	Get persistence, loot creds, and maintain stealth.
	•	Document every step—your report is your exploit write-up.

💡 Red Team Pro Tip
The OSCP isn’t about tool mastery—it’s about your ability to think like an adversary under pressure. Treat every exam box like a real-world target—and remember: enumeration wins wars.
