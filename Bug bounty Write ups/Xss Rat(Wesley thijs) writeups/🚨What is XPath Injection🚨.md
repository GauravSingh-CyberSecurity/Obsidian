What is XPath Injection? 🚨

https://lnkd.in/erh3HRJ4

XPath Injection is a vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate XPath queries, often used in XML-based systems, to retrieve, modify, or delete sensitive data! 🔐

🧐 How Does It Work?
 Attackers can inject malicious input into an XPath query that is used to interact with XML data. By manipulating the query structure, they can bypass authentication or retrieve data that’s not meant to be accessed. The vulnerability exists when user input is directly inserted into an XPath query without proper sanitization.
 
💥 Common Impact
Bypassing authentication systems 🛡️
Accessing sensitive user data 📊
Exploiting backend systems for further attacks ⚡

🔧 How to Prevent XPath Injection:
Sanitize user input to avoid injecting malicious code.
Use parameterized queries or secure libraries.
Validate and escape special characters like //, /*, () in user input.
Implement robust input validation and access control.

💡 Reminder: XPath Injection can be a subtle attack vector, so always validate and sanitize your inputs! Never trust user data blindly. 🚫
