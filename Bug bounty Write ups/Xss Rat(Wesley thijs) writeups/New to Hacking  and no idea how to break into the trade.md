Here is my Top 5 Tips for Getting Into Ethical Hacking with No Experience
1. Understand What Ethical Hacking Really Is
Mindset before tools.

Ethical hacking isn’t just about "breaking into stuff" — it’s about understanding systems so well that you can find vulnerabilities before bad actors do. Learn about:

White Hat vs Black Hat vs Grey Hat hackers

Legal & ethical responsibilities

Bug bounty programs & penetration testing roles

Resources:

Google: "What is Ethical Hacking?" (Cybersecurity framework articles)

Book: Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson

Free Course: Cybrary — Introduction to Ethical Hacking





2. Build a Strong Technical Foundation First
You can’t hack what you don’t understand.

Start by learning:

Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, VPN, Subnetting)

Operating Systems (Linux especially — Kali Linux is a hacking distro)

Basic Programming (Python is gold in security)

Resources:

Networking: CompTIA Network+ materials (free YouTube content available)

Linux: Linux Essentials Course (linuxjourney.com)

Python: Automate the Boring Stuff (automatetheboringstuff.com)






3. Learn Cybersecurity Fundamentals
Security isn’t just hacking — it's a mindset.

Understand:

CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Threat Models

Types of Attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)

Resources:

OWASP Top 10: https://lnkd.in/ean6dHsy

Book: The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook

Free Course: TryHackMe — Introduction to Cyber Security Path






4. Set Up a Safe Hacking Lab
Never practice on systems you don’t own.

Create a home lab environment to practice safely:

Install VirtualBox or VMware

Run Kali Linux (Attacker) & vulnerable machines (like Metasploitable or DVWA)

Practice scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation tactics.

Or just try my labs: https://labs.hackxpert.com






Resources:

VulnHub.com (Download vulnerable VMs)

TryHackMe Labs (Beginner friendly)

Hack The Box (More advanced)






5. Start Learning Tools of the Trade
Tools are like weapons — but useless without skills.
