I've been there. Refreshing scope pages. Watching recon tools run. Questioning my life choices. But let me tell you — your first bug is closer than you think, if you follow a smart system. 🎯

In this guide, I'll walk you step by step on how to find your first valid bug — no theory overload, just real, actionable steps I've tested.

Let's go from zero to your first report. ✅

🔍 Step 1: Choose the Right Platform (and Program)
Don't randomly jump on massive companies like Google or PayPal. Start with new or less noisy programs. Why? Because:

Less competition
More scope flexibility
Easier targets
👉 I recommend checking:

HackerOne New Programs
Bugcrowd Low Hanging Fruit
Intigriti Programs with Zero Reports
💡 Look for programs with: ✅ Wildcard subdomains ✅ Low submission volume ✅ Known tech stack like WordPress, Laravel, etc.

🧠 Step 2: Understand the Scope and Rules
Before touching anything, read the scope. Twice. Most new hunters ignore this and waste hours testing things that are out-of-scope.

📄 Example scope:

*.example.com (includes all subdomains) ✅
mobile app APIs (only iOS) ✅
corporate site (www.example.com) ❌
🛑 Avoid:

Third-party services (like Salesforce) unless explicitly in scope
Denial of Service tests
Automated scanning without permission
🛠️ Step 3: Set Up Your Toolkit (Minimalist Edition)
You don't need 50 tools. You need the right tools.

💻 Here's a beginner-friendly setup:

Recon Tools:
Subfinder 🕵️
httpx 🌐
Nuclei 📄
Waybackurls 🕰️
Manual Testing Tools:
Burp Suite (Community Edition is fine) 🧪
Firefox with extensions like Wappalyzer and HackBar 🔍
🔎 Step 4: Recon and Map the Target
Now it's time to map the attack surface.

Run Subfinder to find subdomains:
subfinder -d example.com -o subs.txt

Use httpx to filter live domains:
cat subs.txt | httpx -status-code -title -o live.txt

Run Nuclei for common misconfigurations:
nuclei -l live.txt -t cves/ -o results.txt
Explore the site manually. Visit every link. Look at every form.
✅ Look for things like:

Login/Signup pages
Contact forms
Upload fields
Parameters in the URL (?id=123)
Forgotten subdomains (dev.example.com, test.example.com)
💥 Step 5: Focus on Easy & Common Bugs
Don't chase fancy RCEs on day one. Start with:

🪲 XSS (Cross-site Scripting)
🪲 IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
🪲 Open Redirects
🪲 Subdomain Takeover
🪲 Sensitive Data in JS files
🔧 Example: Visit dev.example.com, check for robots.txt, open main.js, and find hardcoded credentials. 💣 Boom, report-worthy.

📤 Step 6: Report It Like a Pro
Found something?

Here's how to write a clear, reproducible report:

Title: Clear and specific "Stored XSS on blog.example.com via comment box"
Summary: Explain what the bug is and its impact
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to blog.example.com 2. Click on "Add Comment" 3. Submit <script>alert(1)</script> 4. Refresh the page – XSS fires

Proof of Concept (PoC): Screenshots, Burp logs, or videos
Impact: Explain why it matters to the business.

🎉 Success Stories from Beginners
🌟 Harsh found an IDOR bug in a travel booking app after just 2 weeks of trying. 🌟 Anjali found a reflected XSS in a forgotten marketing subdomain of a big company.

And you can too.

🧘 Final Thoughts: Don't Give Up
Finding your first bug is not about luck, it's about:

✔️ Being consistent ✔️ Staying curious ✔️ Testing smart, not hard

You might spend 10 days and find nothing. Then on day 11, you'll spot that forgotten endpoint or misconfigured subdomain and BAM — you're a bug bounty hunter with a payout. 💰
