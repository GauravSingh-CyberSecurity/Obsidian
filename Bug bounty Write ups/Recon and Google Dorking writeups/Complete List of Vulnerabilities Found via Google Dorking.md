---

🔥 10. XSS (Reflected or Stored Indicators)

Reflected parameters in URLs like ?q=, ?search=, ?s=

Visible payloads in cached pages or archived results



---

🗃 11. File Upload Points (RCE possibilities)

Pages allowing file uploads (upload.php, submit.jsp)

Misconfigured form handlers



---

📜 12. Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Parameters like ?file=, ?page=, ?path=

Known error messages: "failed to open stream", "include()"



---

📷 13. Exposed Cameras, IoT, Routers

"intitle:live view / - Axis" for CCTV

"inurl:view/index.shtml" for routers

"intitle:printer" inurl:hp/device for exposed printers



---

🛰 14. CMS & Plugin Vulnerabilities

WordPress debug or XML-RPC exposed

Joomla/Drupal admin paths

Plugins with known CVEs

Misconfigured or outdated CMS versions



---

📦 15. Package Manager Artifacts

.npmrc, .pypirc, composer.lock, Gemfile.lock, package.json

Often leak package versions and access tokens



---

🧾 16. License Keys & API Tokens

API tokens in JS files

Google Maps, Stripe, AWS, Firebase, Twilio keys exposed



---

🧠 17. OSINT / Bug Bounty Recon

Subdomains via site: and inurl:

Discovery of internal domains, dev/stage environments

Employee details for phishing or social engineering



---

🕵️‍♂️ 18. Archived Vulnerabilities (via Wayback/Cache)

Previously exposed URLs now removed

Wayback links to outdated software versions

Archive of endpoints now gone from production



---

🧬 19. SSRF Indicators

URL parameters accepting external links

Sitemap with internal IPs (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 169.254.*)

Misconfigured dev environments



---

🔗 20. Unintended 3rd-Party Integrations

Exposed webhook URLs

Slack tokens, Discord webhooks

Google Sheets or Firebase endpoints



---

🧷 Bonus: Special Case Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability	Can Be Found?	Notes

Insecure CORS	⚠️ Indirect	Use .js + fetch() patterns
Hardcoded secrets	✅ Yes	In .js, .env, .json
Subdomain Takeover	⚠️ Partial	Use site:* for dead subdomains
SSRF / RFI	⚠️ Indicators	Use parameter exposure hints
Authentication Bypass	❌ No	Needs testing, not visible via dork
Business logic flaws	❌ No	Not detectable via search



---
