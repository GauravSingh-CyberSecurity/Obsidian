Cybersecurity is and will remain one of the most important industries in the world
Yet countless professionals and aspiring newcomers are stuck, frustrated, and jobless.

They've collected certifications. They've submitted dozens (sometimes hundreds) of job applications.

They've watched endless YouTube videos and bootcamps. And still‚Ä¶ nothing.

If that sounds like you, this article is a wake-up call.

There are things you should be doing to advance your cybersecurity career ‚Äî and there are things that are a complete waste of your time.

Let's talk about both. Starting with the distractions.

Don't Waste Time On These
1. Certifications Without Strategy
Certifications aren't worthless ‚Äî but they're not a golden ticket either.

Too many people chase certs blindly, hoping the letters after their name will land them a job.

Here's the truth: a certification with no real-world application is just a badge.

Hiring managers want to see how you use that knowledge.

If you've passed the AWS Security Specialty, great.

But can you secure an AWS environment? Have you written a policy? Built a detection rule? Published a project?

2. Perfecting Your Resume Instead of Showing Value
Your resume won't get you hired.

At best, it might get you seen. And in many cases, it won't even get that far (more on that later).

If you're spending weeks wordsmithing your CV but not building or sharing anything practical, you're missing the point.

Instead:

Build a portfolio on GitHub
Share small security projects on LinkedIn
Write a blog post about a cloud misconfiguration you fixed
You don't need to be perfect ‚Äî you just need to be visible and valuable.

3. Trying to Learn Everything at Once
You don't need to master AppSec, Red Teaming, GRC, Cloud, and Forensics all at the same time.

In fact, trying to do so will guarantee that you get stuck.

Pick a track. Go deep. Focus for 90 days. Then pivot or expand if needed

4. Using LinkedIn as Just a Job Board
You've probably been told: "Apply to as many jobs on LinkedIn as you can." That's a trap.

If you're treating LinkedIn like Indeed ‚Äî just scrolling, clicking "Easy Apply," and firing off the same CV 20 times a day ‚Äî you're doing it wrong.

LinkedIn is not just a job board. It's a networking platform, a credibility builder, and a visibility engine.

Most job applications submitted through LinkedIn never get seen by a human.

You're just one of 300+ people clicking the same button ‚Äî and the algorithm screens most of you out.

Use LinkedIn to:

Engage with people already in roles you want
Showcase your learning, projects, or career journey
Build relationships with hiring managers before you apply
Visibility beats volume ‚Äî every single time.

So What Should You Do Instead?
Here's how to focus your time for actual results:

1. Pick a Niche
Cloud Security
GRC
AppSec
AI Security
Don't dabble. Commit. Learn the tools, build small projects, and write about what you learn.

2. Build a Portfolio
Harden an AWS account
Write IAM policies
Automate a risk assessment template with Agentic AI
Share code on GitHub ‚Äî even if it's messy!
3. Fix Your LinkedIn
Write a sharp headline ("Cloud Security Engineer | GRC | AI Risk")
Post your learnings weekly
Connect with real people in the industry
4. Use AI to Work Smarter
Summarize CV feedback
Build vibe-coded tools
Auto-generate documentation
Practice mock interviews with ChatGPT
Final Thought
Cybersecurity is changing ‚Äî fast. If you waste time on the wrong things, you'll be left behind.

The winners in 2025 and beyond won't be the ones with the most certs. They'll be the ones who:

Build real projects
Understand the business
Adapt to AI
Focus their learning
Show their value publicly
So stop wasting time on what looks good on paper.

Start focusing on what gets you results in the real world.

You've got this. Just aim smarter.
