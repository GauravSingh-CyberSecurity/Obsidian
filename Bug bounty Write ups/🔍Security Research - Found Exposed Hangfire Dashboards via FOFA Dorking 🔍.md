🔍Security Research] - Found Exposed Hangfire Dashboards via FOFA Dorking 🔍

Hey security fam 👋
Sharing one of my recent findings to help beginners learn how passive recon and search engine dorking can reveal real-world vulnerable assets — no brute force, no login, just smart search!




🔥 Target: Hangfire Dashboard (used to monitor background jobs in .NET apps)
🔓 Issue: Dashboard exposed without any authentication
📡 Method Used: FOFA Search Engine
💡 Dork Used:

body="Hangfire Dashboard"


🧠 What is Hangfire?
A job monitoring dashboard for .NET apps. It helps devs/admins track background jobs like mailers, DB tasks, reports, etc. But if it's open to the public, it’s a serious issue.

🔍 How I Found It (Beginner Friendly Guide):

Went to https://fofa.info/ (a search engine for exposed services)
Searched using the dork:
body="Hangfire Dashboard"
Found several publicly accessible dashboards
Picked one target and opened the link in incognito mode
Dashboard loaded without login! — I could see job data, task queues, internal stack traces etc.



⚠️ Why It’s Dangerous:

Internal job/task information exposed
Stack traces can reveal internal logic or sensitive data
If misconfigured, attackers can trigger or delete background jobs
Full visibility of backend workflows
🛡️ Fix:
Admins should never expose Hangfire dashboards without authentication.

💬 For Beginners:
✅ Learn to use search engines like FOFA/Shodan
✅ Try dorks that target common keywords
✅ Always test in incognito to bypass saved sessions
✅ Passive recon = low noise + high impact
