### Why Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

1. **Organization:** OOP helps to organize code by breaking it into smaller, manageable pieces called objects.
2. **Reuse:** You can reuse code easily, which saves time and effort.
3. **Maintenance:** It makes code easier to update and maintain.
4. **Data Protection:** OOP keeps data safe by bundling it with methods that work on the data.
5. **Simplicity:** It hides complex details and shows only whatâ€™s necessary.
6. **Flexibility:** You can use one method to work with different objects.

### Importance of Class and Object

- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines what attributes and methods the objects will have.
- **Object:** An instance of a class. It represents a real thing with specific details.

### Sample Code in Python

```python
# Defining a class
class Car:
    # Class attribute
    type = "Vehicle"

    # Constructor method to initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        # Instance attributes
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    # Method to display car details
    def show_details(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}, Year: {self.year}")

    # Method to start the car
    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model}'s engine is now running.")

# Creating objects (instances) of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2018)

# Accessing class attributes and methods
print(f"Type of car1: {car1.type}")
print(f"Type of car2: {car2.type}")

car1.show_details()
car2.show_details()

car1.start_engine()
car2.start_engine()
```

### Explanation

- **Class Definition:** The `Car` class is like a blueprint. It defines what a car object will have: brand, model, year, and some methods.
- **Constructor:** The `__init__` method sets up (initializes) the object's details.
- **Creating Objects:** `car1` and `car2` are two cars created using the `Car` class blueprint.
- **Using Methods:** The methods `show_details` and `start_engine` are called on the car objects to show details and start the engine.

OOP helps you create organized, reusable, and easy-to-maintain code by using classes and objects.


## OOP Cheatsheet

### 1. Basic Concepts

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
  ```python
  class ClassName:
      # class body
      pass
  ```

- **Object**: An instance of a class.
  ```python
  obj = ClassName()
  ```

- **Attributes**: Variables that belong to a class or an instance of a class.
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name  # instance attribute
          self.age = age
  ```

- **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class.
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
      
      def bark(self):
          print(f"{self.name} says woof!")
  ```

### 2. Four Pillars of OOP

#### 1. Encapsulation

- Bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, a class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self._name = name  # protected attribute
          self.__age = age   # private attribute
      
      def get_age(self):
          return self.__age
  ```

#### 2. Abstraction

- Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

  class Animal(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def make_sound(self):
          pass

  class Dog(Animal):
      def make_sound(self):
          print("Woof")
  ```

#### 3. Inheritance

- Mechanism of basing a class (child class) on another class (parent class), retaining similar implementation.
  ```python
  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name
      
      def make_sound(self):
          pass

  class Dog(Animal):
      def make_sound(self):
          print("Woof")
  ```

#### 4. Polymorphism

- Ability to present the same interface for different underlying data types.
  ```python
  class Cat(Animal):
      def make_sound(self):
          print("Meow")
      
  animals = [Dog("Fido"), Cat("Whiskers")]

  for animal in animals:
      animal.make_sound()
  ```

### 3. Advanced Concepts

#### 1. Class vs. Instance Variables

- **Class Variable**: Shared across all instances.
- **Instance Variable**: Unique to each instance.
  ```python
  class Dog:
      species = 'Canine'  # class variable

      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name  # instance variable
          self.age = age
  ```

#### 2. Class Methods and Static Methods

- **Class Method**: A method bound to the class and not the object of the class.
  ```python
  class Dog:
      species = 'Canine'

      @classmethod
      def get_species(cls):
          return cls.species
  ```

- **Static Method**: A method that does not operate on an instance or the class.
  ```python
  class Math:
      @staticmethod
      def add(x, y):
          return x + y
  ```

#### 3. Method Overriding

- Providing a specific implementation in a subclass for a method already defined in its superclass.
  ```python
  class Animal:
      def make_sound(self):
          print("Some generic sound")

  class Dog(Animal):
      def make_sound(self):
          print("Woof")
  ```

#### 4. Multiple Inheritance

- Inheriting from more than one class.
  ```python
  class Parent1:
      pass

  class Parent2:
      pass

  class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
      pass
  ```

#### 5. The `super()` Function

- Calling the superclass method.
  ```python
  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

  class Dog(Animal):
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          super().__init__(name)
          self.age = age
  ```

### 4. Access Modifiers

- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self):
          self.my_attribute = "I'm public"
  ```

- **Protected**: Prefix with a single underscore (_). Should not be accessed directly, but still possible.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self):
          self._my_attribute = "I'm protected"
  ```

- **Private**: Prefix with double underscore (__). Not accessible directly.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self):
          self.__my_attribute = "I'm private"
  ```

### 5. Special Methods

- **`__init__`**: Constructor method, called when an object is instantiated.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self, value):
          self.value = value
  ```

- **`__str__`**: Method to define the string representation of an object.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self, value):
          self.value = value

      def __str__(self):
          return f"MyClass with value {self.value}"
  ```

### 6. Example Code

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def make_sound(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.age = age
    
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"

dog = Dog("Fido", 3)
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Woof
print(cat.make_sound())  # Output: Meow
```
