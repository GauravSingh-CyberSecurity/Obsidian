==**Operator precedence in C**==
Here's a table listing the operator precedence in C from highest to lowest:

| Precedence | Operators            | Description                               |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1          | `()`                 | Parentheses (grouping)                    |
| 2          | `[]` `->` `.`        | Array subscripting, Structure and union member access |
| 3          | `++` `--` `()` `sizeof` `type` | Postfix increment/decrement, Function call, Size of object, Type cast |
| 4          | `++` `--` `+` `-` `!` `~` `*` `&` `(type)` `sizeof` | Prefix increment/decrement, Unary plus/minus, Logical NOT, Bitwise NOT, Indirection (dereference), Address-of, Type cast, Size of object |
| 5          | `*` `/` `%`          | Multiplication, Division, Modulus        |
| 6          | `+` `-`              | Addition, Subtraction                    |
| 7          | `<<` `>>`            | Bitwise left shift, Bitwise right shift  |
| 8          | `<` `<=` `>` `>=`    | Less than, Less than or equal to, Greater than, Greater than or equal to |
| 9          | `==` `!=`            | Equal to, Not equal to                  |
| 10         | `&`                  | Bitwise AND                              |
| 11         | `^`                  | Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)               |
| 12         | `|`                  | Bitwise OR (inclusive OR)               |
| 13         | `&&`                 | Logical AND                              |
| 14         | `||`                 | Logical OR                               |
| 15         | `?:`                 | Ternary conditional (conditional operator) |
| 16         | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` `^=` `|=` | Assignment operators |
| 17         | `,`                  | Comma (separates expressions)            |

This table provides a reference for understanding the order in which operators are evaluated in C expressions.
