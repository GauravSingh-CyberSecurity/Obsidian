To earn the **OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert)** certification, the primary required course is:

### 🧠 **WEB‑300: Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (AWAE)**

— 🏅 Leads directly to the **OSWE** certification

---

However, depending on your current skill level, **OffSec and the community** recommend a learning progression that includes other foundational courses to prepare you properly for WEB‑300.
