### 💡 Important Notes

- You **cannot register directly** for the OSWE exam without buying the **WEB‑300 course**.
- OffSec’s **WEB‑300 is a white-box exploitation course**: you’re given source code of web apps and must find and exploit logic flaws, RCEs, deserialization bugs, etc.
- If you’re strong in the basics, you can **jump straight to WEB‑300**, but doing WEB‑100 and reviewing PortSwigger Academy helps solidify your base.
