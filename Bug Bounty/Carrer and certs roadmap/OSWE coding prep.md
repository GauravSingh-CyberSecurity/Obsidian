Thanks for clarifying, Gaurav. Let’s assess your readiness and answer your question step-by-step.

### 🧠 What Coding Knowledge You Likely Have (based on our chats)

You already have:

- ✅ Python scripting (automation, VAPT, bug bounty)
- ✅ Shell scripting & Linux usage
- ✅ Some exposure to PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (through bug bounty/CTFs)
- ✅ OSINT, web app security, Burp Suite, API testing, basic reverse shells
- ✅ You’ve completed HTB BBH and CBBH → good exposure to OWASP & real-world apps

### 📘 OffSec AppSec Track Flow & Coding Requirements

|**Course**|**Need for Coding?**|**Required Knowledge**|
|---|---|---|
|**Linux 101**|❌ No|Basic CLI, shell|
|**Net 101**|❌ No|TCP/IP, ports|
|**PY 101**|✅ Beginner Python|Variables, loops, funcs|
|**WEB 100**|✅ Very Basic|HTTP, HTML, Burp basics|
|**WEB 200**|✅ Moderate|JS basics, web attacks, some fuzzing|
|**WEB 300 (AWAE)**|✅✅ Advanced|JS deobfuscation, Python, REST API abuse, source code review (Node.js, Java, PHP, etc.)|
|**WEB 400**|✅✅✅ Expert|Real exploit dev, patch diffing, deep JS/Node/Java understanding|

---

### ✅ So, Are You Ready?

**YES**, you're absolutely ready to start this track. Here's why:

- Your **current coding knowledge is sufficient for PY101 → WEB100 → WEB200**
- You **might need to upskill slightly** (especially JS, source code review) before/while doing **WEB300**
- **WEB400** requires strong web exploit dev. By the time you reach that, you’ll have gained enough.

### 🔁 Recommendations

|Step|What to Do|
|---|---|
|1️⃣|Do **PY101** (free) – Refresh + cover any gaps|
|2️⃣|Do **Linux101, Net101, Web100** (all free)|
|3️⃣|Purchase and complete **WEB200**|
|4️⃣|Do **HTB AppSec Path**, **PortSwigger Labs**, or **TryHackMe** in parallel|
|5️⃣|Then move to **WEB300 (AWAE)**|
|6️⃣|After OSWE, consider **WEB400** if you're ready for advanced R&D level work|

---

### 🔧 Optional Coding to Strengthen

Before AWAE (WEB300), brush up on:

- **JavaScript** (closures, promises, XSS patterns)
- **Python** (Flask/Django basics)
- **PHP** (if you’ve done Laravel, you’re already part-way there)
- **Code reading** (go through GitHub apps or challenges)
