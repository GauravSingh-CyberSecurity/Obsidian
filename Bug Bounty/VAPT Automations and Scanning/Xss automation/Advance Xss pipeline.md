Perfect, Gaurav. Here's what you asked: **Separate pipelines** for each XSS type (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based, Blind), and each type includes:

- ✅ Fully Automated
- 🧠 Fully Manual
- ⚖️ Semi-Automated

All provided in **Mermaid flowchart format**, clean and rendering-ready.

---

## ✅ Reflected XSS Pipelines

### 1. Fully Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Collect URLs with gau or hakrawler] --> B[Find params using gf xss or ParamSpider]
  B --> C[Scan with Dalfox or XSStrike]
  C --> D[Use Burp Pro scanner to crawl and audit]
  D --> E[Auto detect reflection in response]
  E --> F[Log results as Reflected XSS]
```

### 2. Fully Manual

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Manually open target URLs] --> B[Identify query parameters]
  B --> C[Inject XSS payloads manually in URL]
  C --> D[Check response in browser or source code]
  D --> E[Look for reflection near HTML or script context]
  E --> F[Confirm alert or JS execution]
  F --> G[Report with proof of concept]
```

### 3. Semi-Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Run gau and httpx to collect URLs] --> B[Use gf xss to filter injectable URLs]
  B --> C[Run Dalfox in pipe mode]
  C --> D[Send top payloads to Burp Repeater]
  D --> E[Render in browser or check DevTools]
  E --> F[Confirm JS execution and report]
```

## 🗃️ Stored XSS Pipelines

### 1. Fully Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Use Burp Pro to spider input forms] --> B[Run Scanner with Stored XSS payloads]
  B --> C[Run XSStrike in stored mode]
  C --> D[Monitor if payload is shown on any page]
  D --> E[Auto-detect execution in response rendering]
  E --> F[Log stored XSS issue]
```

### 2. Fully Manual

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Find input forms like comments or profile fields] --> B[Manually inject payload like script alert]
  B --> C[Visit page where data is shown]
  C --> D[Observe execution like popup or script]
  D --> E[Confirm storage and trigger source]
  E --> F[Document payload, field, and page for PoC]
```

### 3. Semi-Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Auto-discover forms using Burp or ZAP] --> B[Inject stored XSS payloads manually]
  B --> C[Use Burp Repeater to resubmit variations]
  C --> D[Visit rendering page in Burp browser or Chrome]
  D --> E[Confirm JS execution]
  E --> F[Report Stored XSS]
```

## 🧠 DOM-based XSS Pipelines

### 1. Fully Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Extract JavaScript files using gau or LinkFinder] --> B[Scan with DeepScrub or XSStrike]
  B --> C[Enable DOM Invader in Burp Browser]
  C --> D[Visit URLs, auto-inject payloads in DOM]
  D --> E[Detect sink execution]
  E --> F[Log DOM-based XSS]
```

### 2. Fully Manual

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Open JS files manually or in DevTools] --> B[Search for sinks like innerHTML, eval]
  B --> C[Inject payload in hash or query string]
  C --> D[Observe DOM changes in Elements tab]
  D --> E[Set breakpoints or use console.log]
  E --> F[Confirm DOM-based XSS and document]
```

### 3. Semi-Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Collect JS files with LinkFinder] --> B[Load URLs in Burp browser]
  B --> C[Use DOM Invader to trace sources and sinks]
  C --> D[Inject payload in controlled input like hash]
  D --> E[Check if script is executed]
  E --> F[Confirm DOM-based XSS and record line of code]
```

## 🕵️ Blind XSS Pipelines

### 1. Fully Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Inject payloads using Dalfox or Burp scanner] --> B[Use Interact.sh or Collaborator payloads]
  B --> C[Send into hidden inputs or headers]
  C --> D[Wait for OOB pingback on server]
  D --> E[Log DNS/HTTP interaction]
  E --> F[Confirm Blind XSS triggered]
```

### 2. Fully Manual

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Identify unvalidated inputs or headers] --> B[Inject <script src=callback.js> payload]
  B --> C[Monitor DNS/HTTP logs or Interact.sh]
  C --> D[Wait for unexpected callback]
  D --> E[Verify payload executed in unknown context]
  E --> F[Document entry point and callback result]
```

### 3. Semi-Automated

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Inject blind XSS payloads manually in Burp Repeater] --> B[Use Burp Collaborator or Interact.sh]
  B --> C[Send payload in User-Agent, Referer, feedback form]
  C --> D[Monitor external logs for pingback]
  D --> E[Validate request context]
  E --> F[Classify as Blind XSS and report]
```
