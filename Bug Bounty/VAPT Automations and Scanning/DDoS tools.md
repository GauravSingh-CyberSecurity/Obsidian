Here‚Äôs a list of **DoS (Denial-of-Service)** and **DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service)** tools that have been **used in real-world attacks** by **elite hacker groups**, APTs, and hacktivist collectives. These tools have been identified from threat intelligence reports, leaked data, and malware analysis by cybersecurity researchers.

## üî• **Real-World DoS/DDoS Tools Used by Elite Hacker Groups**

|Tool Name|Type|Used By|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)**|DoS/DDoS|Anonymous, LulzSec|Open-source, sends TCP/UDP/HTTP floods. Often used in hacktivist operations.|
|**HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon)**|DoS/DDoS|Anonymous|More powerful than LOIC, uses ‚Äúbooster‚Äù scripts.|
|**Mirai**|DDoS Botnet|Various APTs & criminal gangs|Botnet of IoT devices. Used in the largest DDoS attacks in history (DynDNS).|
|**Mƒìris**|DDoS Botnet|Unknown (state-sponsored suspected)|Huge bandwidth (21.8 million RPS). Exploits MikroTik routers.|
|**Perlbot / Kaiten**|DDoS Bot|IRC bot, used by various groups|Classic DDoS bot used in early IRC-based botnets.|
|**C2Storm**|DoS/DDoS|Nation-State APTs|Believed to be custom C2 for TCP/UDP/ICMP flood.|
|**XOR DDoS**|Linux Botnet|Chinese APTs|Compromises Linux servers. Uses rootkits for persistence.|
|**BASHLITE (aka Lizkebab / Torlus)**|DDoS Botnet|Criminal groups|Infects IoT devices. Used with Mirai in hybrid botnets.|
|**Tor's Hammer**|DoS|Hacktivists|Slow POST DoS tool over Tor network. Bypasses basic WAF.|
|**RUDY (R-U-Dead-Yet?)**|DoS|Hacktivists / Pentesters|Slow HTTP POST DDoS. Aimed at exhausting server threads.|
|**BlackEnergy**|DoS/DDoS + Malware|APT28 / Sandworm (Russian)|Used in Ukraine attacks. Modular, includes DDoS and cyber espionage.|
|**HTTP Unbearable Load King (HULK)**|HTTP DDoS|Hacktivists / Researchers|Generates unique headers to evade caching and flood web servers.|
|**XORDDoS**|DDoS Bot|Chinese threat actors|Linux-based. Uses XOR encryption for C2 traffic.|
|**YoyoDDoS**|DDoS Botnet|Observed in China-origin attacks|Similar to XORDDoS but more advanced evasion.|
|**Tsunami**|IRC Botnet|Various|Linux-based tool for DoS/DDoS using SYN/ACK floods.|
|**Optane**|DDoS-as-a-Service|Leaked criminal toolkit|Available on dark web, used by groups with financial motives.|
|**Dark Nexus**|Botnet|Unknown elite group|Targets smart devices. Strong persistence and scanning modules.|
|**Mantis Botnet**|DDoS (HTTPS floods)|Cloud infrastructure abuse|Believed to use compromised servers for extreme RPS attacks.|
|**Vulcanbot**|DDoS + Spam|Chinese nationalist hackers|Used in anti-Falun Gong operations.|

## üß† **Bonus: Nation-State Grade DDoS Campaigns**

|Campaign Name|Suspected Group|Tools|
|---|---|---|
|**Olympic Destroyer**|Russian APT (Sandworm)|BlackEnergy + DDoS + Wiper|
|**Project Sauron**|Nation-State APT|Custom traffic manipulation tools|
|**Operation Ababil**|Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters|Brobot, used in U.S. bank DDoS attacks|
|**NotPetya Campaign (Phase 1)**|Sandworm|BlackEnergy / KillDisk w/ DDoS|

## üõ†Ô∏è **Common Methods Used by Elite Groups**

- TCP SYN floods
- UDP Amplification (NTP, DNS, Memcached)
- HTTP Layer 7 (slowloris, slow POST)
- Botnets (IoT, Linux servers, cloud instances)
- C2 over Tor or custom protocols
- Load-based DDoS mixed with wipers or malware

If you're looking to simulate these **in a lab for educational or red team** purposes, I can list safe versions and mitigations as well.
