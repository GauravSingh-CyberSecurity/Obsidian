There isn’t a single place that has every scanner’s commands in one document, but there are a few solid resources where you can find cheat sheets and command lists for most commonly used security scanners. Here are the best options:

1. GitHub Repositories (Best for Cheat Sheets & Command Lists)

PayloadsAllTheThings – GitHub Link(https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)

Contains scanning, exploitation, and enumeration commands for tools like Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, etc.


Red Teaming & Pentesting Notes – GitHub Link ( )

Has scanner commands for Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite, Nikto, OpenVAS, etc.


HackTricks – Website( https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html)

Great for security scanning and enumeration commands.



2. Penetration Testing Cheat Sheets (Websites & PDFs)

HighOn.Coffee Security Cheat Sheets – Link https://highon.coffee/blog/

GTFOBins – Link (Great for privilege escalation) https://gtfobins.github.io/


1. Kali Linux Command Cheatsheet (Covers Most Scanners)

If you use Kali Linux, it has built-in cheatsheets under /usr/share/doc/

You can also check Kali Tools Website for a categorized list of scanners and their commands.


2. Create Your Own Centralized Document

If you want a single place for all commands, create your own Markdown or Notion page where you keep:

Common commands for Nmap, Nikto, Burp Suite, Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.

Useful one-liners for automation.

Output analysis tips.


Would you like me to generate a customized cheat sheet for the scanners you use most?
