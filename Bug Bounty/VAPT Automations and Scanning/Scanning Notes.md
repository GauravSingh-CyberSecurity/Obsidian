There is automation for everything, from scanning to executing commands on Linux machine 


# open-source alternatives to Nessus


If you're looking for **open-source alternatives** to Nessus, here are some great options:

### **1. OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Management - GVM) 🚀**

✅ **Best Nessus alternative** – Full-featured and open-source.  
✅ **Regular vulnerability updates** (via Greenbone).  
✅ **Supports compliance checks** (CIS, PCI-DSS, etc.).  
✅ **Web-based interface** for easy management.  
🚫 **Setup is complex** compared to Nessus.

🔹 **Installation (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvas -y
sudo gvm-setup
```

🔹 **Access:** `https://<your-server-ip>:9392`

---

### **2. Nmap + Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) 🔍**

✅ **Powerful and lightweight** network scanning tool.  
✅ Supports **vulnerability scanning via NSE scripts**.  
✅ No GUI, but integrates with Zenmap (GUI for Nmap).  
🚫 **Does not offer automated reporting** like Nessus.

🔹 **Installation (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt install nmap -y
```

🔹 **Basic Vulnerability Scan Example:**

```bash
nmap --script vuln <target-ip>
```

---

### **3. Nikto (Web Application Scanner) 🌐**

✅ Best for **web application security assessments**.  
✅ Detects **misconfigurations, outdated software, and vulnerabilities**.  
🚫 **Not a full system vulnerability scanner**.

🔹 **Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install nikto -y
```

🔹 **Basic Scan Example:**

```bash
nikto -h http://target.com
```

---

### **4. Wapiti (Web Vulnerability Scanner) 🛠️**

✅ Focused on **web vulnerabilities** (XSS, SQLi, LFI, etc.).  
✅ Supports **passive and active scanning**.  
🚫 No GUI, purely CLI-based.

🔹 **Installation (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt install wapiti -y
```

🔹 **Basic Scan Example:**

```bash
wapiti -u http://target.com
```

---

### **Which One to Choose?**

- **For network scanning:** OpenVAS, Nmap
- **For web app scanning:** Nikto, Wapiti
- **For enterprise-level alternative:** OpenVAS

# Notes
There isn’t a single place that has every scanner’s commands in one document, but there are a few solid resources where you can find cheat sheets and command lists for most commonly used security scanners. Here are the best options:

1. GitHub Repositories (Best for Cheat Sheets & Command Lists)

PayloadsAllTheThings – GitHub Link(https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)

Contains scanning, exploitation, and enumeration commands for tools like Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, etc.


Red Teaming & Pentesting Notes – GitHub Link ( )

Has scanner commands for Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite, Nikto, OpenVAS, etc.


HackTricks – Website( https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html)

Great for security scanning and enumeration commands.



2. Penetration Testing Cheat Sheets (Websites & PDFs)

SANS Penetration Testing Cheat Sheets – Link

HighOn.Coffee Security Cheat Sheets – Link https://highon.coffee/blog/

GTFOBins – Link (Great for privilege escalation) https://gtfobins.github.io/


1. Kali Linux Command Cheatsheet (Covers Most Scanners)

If you use Kali Linux, it has built-in cheatsheets under /usr/share/doc/

You can also check Kali Tools Website ( https://www.kali.org/tools/for) a categorized list of scanners and their commands.


2. Create Your Own Centralized Document

If you want a single place for all commands, create your own Markdown or Notion page where you keep:

Common commands for Nmap, Nikto, Burp Suite, Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.

Useful one-liners for automation.

Output analysis tips.

# Server Scanners


To scan a server, you’ll need different types of scanners based on what you’re looking for. Here’s a categorized list of the best tools:


---

1. Network & Port Scanning (Find open ports, services, and firewall rules)

Nmap – The best general-purpose network scanner

nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 <server-ip> (Comprehensive scan)


Masscan – Faster alternative to Nmap for large networks

masscan -p1-65535 <server-ip> --rate=10000 (Full port scan)


Unicornscan – Used for stealthy scanning

unicornscan -mT -v -I <server-ip>




---

2. Web Application Scanning (Find web vulnerabilities)

Nikto – Basic web vulnerability scanner

nikto -h <server-ip>


Burp Suite – Advanced web application testing (manual + automated)

Use Burp Scanner for automated checks


OWASP ZAP – Open-source web vulnerability scanner

zap-cli quick-scan -r -s all <server-ip>


Dirb/Dirbuster/Gobuster – Directory and file brute-forcing

gobuster dir -u http://<server-ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt




---

1. Vulnerability Scanning (Automated security assessments)

Nessus – Industry-standard vulnerability scanner (requires setup)

Run a Basic Network Scan in the GUI


OpenVAS (Greenbone Security Manager) – Open-source alternative to Nessus

openvas-cli --target <server-ip>


Qualys SSL Labs Scanner – Check SSL/TLS misconfigurations

Use the web tool: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/




---

2. Exploit Scanning (Checking if the server has known exploits)

Metasploit Framework – Find and exploit vulnerabilities

msfconsole → use auxiliary/scanner/http/title


SearchSploit – Check for publicly available exploits

searchsploit <software/version>


Shodan/Censys – Find exposed servers and services

shodan search <server-ip>




---

3. Cloud & API Security Scanning

AWS Prowler – Security assessment for AWS

prowler -c all -M csv


GCP ScoutSuite – Security assessment for Google Cloud

scout gcp


Postman/OWASP ZAP API Scanner – API vulnerability scanning



---

Best Approach for Server Scanning:

4. Start with Nmap – Find open ports/services


5. Use Nikto or ZAP for web scanning


6. Run Nessus/OpenVAS for vulnerability assessment


7. Use Metasploit/SearchSploit to check for known exploits


8. For cloud servers, use Prowler (AWS) or ScoutSuite (GCP)
