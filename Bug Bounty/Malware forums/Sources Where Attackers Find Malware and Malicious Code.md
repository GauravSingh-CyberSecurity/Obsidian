# Sources Where Attackers Find Malware and Malicious Code

Based on comprehensive cybersecurity research, threat actors obtain malware and malicious code from various sources across the cybercriminal ecosystem. Understanding these sources is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to better defend against emerging threats.

## Dark Web Forums and Underground Marketplaces

### Major Cybercriminal Forums

The dark web hosts numerous forums where threat actors share, sell, and distribute malware[1]. Some of the most prominent include:

**XSS Forum** - One of the oldest Russian-speaking forums dating back to 2013, hosting prominent threat actors including LockBit, ALPHV/BlackCat, REvil, and the DarkSide group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline attack[1].

**BreachForums** - Despite multiple shutdowns and resurrections, this English-language forum remains influential in the cybercriminal ecosystem. Nine of the top 15 most active threat actors between 2024 and 2025 were associated with BreachForums[1].

**LeakBase** - Focuses primarily on data leaks and stealer logs, featuring a high volume of credential pairs and compromised information with a credit-based economy[1].

**Dread** - Often compared to Reddit due to its community structure, this forum facilitates discussions about ransomware operations, darknet markets, and credential leaks[1].

**RAMP (Russian Anonymous Market Place)** - Established in 2021, this multilingual forum serves as a vital point for Ransomware-as-a-Service groups to recruit hackers and sell initial access[1].

### Underground Marketplaces

Dark web marketplaces function similarly to legitimate e-commerce platforms, complete with ratings, reviews, and transaction histories[2]. These markets offer:

- Malware packages and exploit kits
- Social engineering scripts and phishing kits  
- Botnet rental services
- Stolen credentials and data leaks
- Zero-day exploits priced up to several million dollars[3]

## Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) Platforms

### The MaaS Business Model

Malware-as-a-Service has revolutionized cybercrime by democratizing access to sophisticated attack tools[4]. This subscription-based model allows threat actors with limited technical expertise to launch advanced attacks using professionally developed malware.

**Key MaaS Characteristics:**
- Subscription-based pricing models
- 24/7 customer support and documentation
- Continuous updates and evasion techniques
- User-friendly dashboards for campaign management
- Revenue-sharing arrangements between developers and affiliates[5][4]

**Popular MaaS Offerings:**
- **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** - The most expensive type with average costs of $7,500[3]
- **Infostealers** - The most popular malware type on dark web markets, representing 19% of all malware[3]
- **Banking trojans and credential stealers**
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**
- **Botnet services**

### Distribution Networks

**Traffic Distribution Systems (TDSs)** like BlackTDS and Keitaro provide sophisticated filtering capabilities, allowing attackers to evade detection while successfully redirecting victims to malicious content[6].

## Cybercriminal Supply Chain

### Initial Access Brokers

Storm-0324 exemplifies the modern cybercriminal supply chain, acting as a distributor that provides initial access services to other threat actors[6]. These groups:

- Specialize in gaining initial network access through phishing and exploit kits
- Hand off compromised systems to ransomware operators and other attackers
- Use highly evasive infection chains with payment and invoice lures
- Operate through affiliate programs with revenue-sharing models

### Communication Channels

Threat actors increasingly use legitimate platforms to distribute malware:

**YouTube Channel Hijacking** - Attackers steal popular channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers to distribute infostealers like Vidar and LummaC2 through video descriptions and comments[7].

**Social Media and Messaging Platforms** - Telegram channels, Discord servers, and other messaging platforms facilitate malware distribution and coordination.

## Legitimate Services Abuse

### Compromised Infrastructure

Attackers exploit legitimate internet services and content delivery networks:

- **Cloudflare and other CDNs** - Increasingly abused for malware distribution[8]
- **File hosting services** - Used to host malware disguised as legitimate software
- **Social media platforms** - Exploited for phishing campaigns and malware distribution

### Supply Chain Attacks

Threat actors target software supply chains by:
- Compromising software repositories
- Injecting malicious code into legitimate applications
- Exploiting update mechanisms in popular software

## Research and Intelligence Sources

### Malware Sample Repositories

While primarily intended for legitimate research, these repositories can be targets for threat actors seeking samples to reverse-engineer or modify:

**Public Repositories:**
- **MalwareBazaar** - Community-driven platform with extensive malware samples[9]
- **VirusShare** - Contains over 37 million malware samples[10]  
- **VirusSign** - Offers over 300TB and 700 million malware metadata and samples[11]
- **vx-underground** - Publicly accessible repositories of malware samples and source code[12]

**Research Platforms:**
- **VirusTotal** - Multi-engine scanning service with large sample database[13]
- **Hybrid Analysis** - Provides detailed malware analysis reports[10]
- **theZoo** - GitHub project offering live malware samples for research[10]

## Geographic and Hosting Patterns

### Primary Hosting Locations

Research indicates that **China and the United States** are the top hosting locations for malicious infrastructure[8]. However, attackers frequently use:

- Bulletproof hosting providers
- Compromised legitimate websites
- Cloud service providers with lax security controls
- Tor hidden services for anonymity

### State-Sponsored Resources

Nation-state actors maintain sophisticated malware development capabilities:

- **China** - Notably increased use of relay networks like ArcSilt[8]
- **Russia** - Continued abuse of legitimate internet services for malware distribution[8]
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups** - Develop custom malware for espionage and sabotage

## Emerging Trends and Innovations

### AI-Enhanced Development

Cybercriminals increasingly use artificial intelligence to:
- Automate attack processes and make them more efficient[14]
- Develop polymorphic malware that evades detection
- Create more convincing social engineering content

### Mobile Malware Growth

**Android remains the primary target** for mobile malware, with threats like Hook leading the mobile malware landscape[8]. Mobile-specific distribution channels include:
- Third-party app stores
- Malicious game modifications
- SMS-based distribution campaigns

The cybercriminal ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with attackers constantly adapting their sourcing methods to evade law enforcement and security measures. Understanding these sources enables cybersecurity professionals to better anticipate threats and develop more effective defensive strategies.
