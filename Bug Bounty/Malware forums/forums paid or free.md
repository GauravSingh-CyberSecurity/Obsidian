are these forums paid or free

The forums and marketplaces listed above use three main access models:

| Platform | Entry Cost | Notes on Ongoing Costs |
|---|---|---|
| XSS | One-time “autoreg” fee (≈$100) OR proof of reputation on another elite forum | No renewal; must load wallet to buy/sell. |
| BreachForums* | Free sign-up | Premium sections or bulk downloads require purchased credits (≈$10–$50 bundles). |
| LeakBase | Free account | Buying leaked databases requires internal credits (packs start around $5). |
| Exploit.in | Closed; either sponsorship or ≈$100 application fee | No further mandatory fees; transactions handled peer-to-peer. |
| Dread | Completely free to join on Tor | Listing items in vendor “subdreads” may incur ad or escrow fees. |
| Russian Market | Free registration, but you must pre-deposit $40–$100 in crypto before you can view full inventories or purchase logs. |
| Abacus Market | Free entry | Must fund wallet to purchase; no fixed minimum. |
| BriansClub | Free account, but it will be deleted if no deposit (≈$50–$200) is made within five days. |
| STYX Market | Free sign-up; browsing heavily restricted until a deposit (≈$20–$50) is made. |
| Exodus Marketplace | Free registration | Each bot log costs $3–$10; sellers pay listing fees. |

*BreachForums’ name persists across multiple reincarnations; each spin-off keeps a similar “free-entry, pay-for-features” structure.

Key points:

-  Truly free, no-deposit forums are rare—Dread is the main outlier.  
-  Russian-language elite boards (XSS, Exploit.in) gatekeep with a one-time fee or an existing reputation to deter law-enforcement and amateurs.  
-  Markets focused on stolen credentials (Russian Market, BriansClub, STYX) demand an immediate crypto balance, filtering out casual browsers.  

So, access is almost never completely free once you want to download malware, buy data, or post listings; either an upfront fee or a mandatory wallet top-up is the norm.
