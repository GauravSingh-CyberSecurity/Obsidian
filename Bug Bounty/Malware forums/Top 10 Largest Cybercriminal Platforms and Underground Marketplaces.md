# Top 10 Largest Cybercriminal Platforms and Underground Marketplaces

Based on comprehensive cybersecurity intelligence research, here are the **top 10 biggest underground platforms** where the vast majority of malware, stolen data, and cybercriminal activities are concentrated:

## Major Dark Web Forums

### 1. **XSS (formerly DaMaGeLaB)**
One of the oldest and most influential Russian-speaking cybercrime forums, established in 2013[1]. XSS hosts prominent threat actors including LockBit, ALPHV/BlackCat, REvil, and the DarkSide group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline attack[1]. It operates on both Tor and surface web, serving as a central hub for ransomware-as-a-service groups and malware distribution.

### 2. **BreachForums** 
Despite multiple shutdowns and resurrections, this English-language forum remains one of the most significant platforms in cybercrime history. **Nine of the top 15 most active threat actors between 2024 and 2025 were associated with BreachForums**[1]. While the original has been taken down, various iterations continue to emerge.

### 3. **LeakBase**
A major English-speaking forum focused on data leaks and stealer logs[1]. It maintains a continuously updated archive of leaked databases and features a high volume of stealer log data, including credential pairs and combo lists. The platform operates with a credit-based economy and clear organizational structure.

### 4. **Exploit.in**
Established in 2005, this is one of the leading Russian hacker forums alongside XSS[1]. It serves as a rendezvous point for initial access brokers and facilitates unauthorized access sales, malware dissemination, and database transactions. The forum maintains strict membership policies and organizational discipline.

### 5. **Dread**
Often compared to Reddit due to its community structure, Dread is one of the most active English-speaking forums on the Dark Web[1]. Established in 2018, it facilitates discussions about ransomware operations, darknet market shutdowns, and credential leaks, featuring topic-specific "subdreads" for different cybercriminal activities.

## Major Dark Web Marketplaces

### 6. **Russian Market**
Launched in 2019, this is one of the most active dark web markets for stolen digital data[2]. It specializes in credentials, stealer logs, CVVs, and RDP access, offering logs harvested by popular infostealer malware such as Lumma, RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, and Aurora. The platform requires a minimum deposit of $40-$100 to access full features.

### 7. **Abacus Market**
Launched in 2021, Abacus quickly became a major player with over 40,000 listings[2]. It offers illegal drugs, counterfeit documents, stolen credit card data, fake IDs, phishing kits, and hacking tools. The marketplace features strong security measures including PGP encryption, 2FA, and vendor verification systems.

### 8. **BriansClub**
One of the longest-running dark web markets for stolen payment card data, active since at least 2014[2]. It specializes in credit card dumps, CVVs, and complete identity data sets. Despite being breached in 2019 with over 26 million card records leaked, it remains active and continues updating its inventory frequently.

### 9. **STYX Market**
Launched in 2023, STYX is a fast-growing marketplace focused on financial cybercrime[2]. It offers stealer logs, RDP access, brute-forced accounts, and full identity packages. The platform serves data brokers, initial access brokers, and threat actors targeting corporate environments, with real-time inventory updates and rich filtering options.

### 10. **Genesis Market**
While Genesis Market was taken down in 2023, its successor **Exodus Marketplace** emerged in early 2024[2]. Exodus focuses on stealer logs from compromised devices and claims to manage over 7,000 bots from 190+ countries, with prices ranging from $3 to $10 depending on data quality.

## Additional Notable Platforms

**RAMP (Russian Anonymous Market Place)** - Established in 2021, serves as a vital point for Ransomware-as-a-Service groups to recruit hackers and sell initial access[1].

**Torzon Market** - Launched in 2022, offers over 20,000 listings across various cybercriminal categories with daily URL rotation and escrow protection[2].

**BidenCash** - A marketplace launched in 2022 that gained attention through promotional data dumps of millions of credit card records[2].

These platforms represent the core infrastructure of the global cybercriminal ecosystem, facilitating billions of dollars in illegal transactions annually and serving as the primary sources where attackers obtain malware, stolen data, and cybercriminal services. Understanding these major players is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and law enforcement agencies working to combat cybercrime.
