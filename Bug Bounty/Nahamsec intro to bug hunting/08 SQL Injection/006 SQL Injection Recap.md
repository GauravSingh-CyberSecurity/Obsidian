SQL injection is a crucial vulnerability to look for when analyzing application requests. It is essential to identify abnormalities in responses when sending queries, as SQL injection can sometimes be tedious to detect.

There are many great tools available for SQL injection testing, but understanding how it works is key. The way I approach SQL injection is by reminding myself that I am somewhere inside an SQL queryâ€”I just need to figure out where. Identifying the exact location of the injection point in an application is crucial.

For example, if you find an injection in an update function, you are likely within an `UPDATE` statement and need to determine how to insert your query and properly terminate the existing one. If you're retrieving data, such as accessing an article by ID, you are likely within a `SELECT` statement, and your goal is to break out of that query and inject your own.

Blind SQL injection can be especially tricky because it does not always provide direct error messages. Regular SQL injections might return database errors, revealing useful insights. However, blind SQL injection requires you to infer the database's response by using techniques like time-based or boolean-based injections. You need to determine whether the backend can be manipulated using time delays (`SLEEP` or `BENCHMARK`) or logic-based conditions to infer true/false responses.

To master SQL injection, review the concepts thoroughly and practice with different labs. Understanding how injections work and how applications process queries is essential.

When searching for SQL injection vulnerabilities, focus on areas where numerical IDs are used in URLs or parameters. APIs can sometimes be vulnerable, but traditional SQL injections are more common in places where numerical values are used for data retrieval. For example, if you see a parameter like `?id=1`, it is a good candidate for testing. Similarly, if a `POST` request contains an `ID` field, it might be worth testing for injection vulnerabilities.

Do not hesitate to test by adding quotation marks (`'`), observing errors, and adjusting payloads accordingly. If a response suggests SQL injection, explore further; if not, move on to other potential vulnerabilities. Understanding how to test for and exploit SQL injection effectively can be highly valuable in penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.

00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,430
So to recap, SQL injection is very, very important to look for abnormalities when you're sending a

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,190
request, SQL injection could be very, very tedious.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,810
Ton of good tools out there that does it, but it really comes down to actually understanding how it

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,140
works.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,980
The way I look at a single injection is always reminding myself that I'm somewhere and a sequel query.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,910
We don't know where we have to figure it out.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,830
And that's kind of obvious when it comes down to the application or the part of the application that

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,410
you're talking.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,380
So, for example, if you're updating something and you have a sequel injection, more than likely you

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,270
are in an updated statement where you have to figure out how to put your next query in it and how to

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,290
end that previous one.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,990
If you are just viewing something like you're going to article about it equal to something that's fetching

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,000
data, you know, you're in a select and you want to break out of that Krenzler query and add your own

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,780
query to it.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,640
When it comes down to blind SQL injection could get very, very tricky.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,350
You have to understand exactly where you are with regular simple injection that gives your hand and

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,520
tells you, hey, your secret query and update has this error, but you don't have this luxury when

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,320
it comes out to buy a single injection.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,880
So you want to make sure you understand where you are, how to end it, and what are you going to abuse?

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,310
What functionality you going to abuse?

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,070
Is that a sleep?

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,640
Is it a benchmark with the backend is to make sure you make it a time based or a boolean based attack

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,650
where it tells you if the statement that you have sent it is true or false, take some time, go back

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,680
and review all these slides from this chapter, make sure you understand how a injection works and spend

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:34,380
some time with different labs, including ones included in this course, and make sure you get very

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,220
familiar with it.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,520
SQL injection could be very, very lucrative, but just hard to look for.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,690
And you have to just pay attention to everything that's happening around the application and knowing

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,600
where to look for it.

30
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,410
So places that I like to look for it is anywhere that I see an ID, some sort of ID.

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,980
That's a numerical thing that says, hey, I want you to fetch this data.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,300
Not really in an API.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,040
I don't look for those.

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,430
There are sometimes valid.

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,890
You can see the rest API, but in other ways, when you see a question mark, some parameter looking

36
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,860
to a number, you can try SQL injection there.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,450
If you see a post request without changing data, it says ID quotation mark one.

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,650
You want to go ahead and look and see if that is also vulnerable to conjecture.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,280
So again, don't be afraid of putting a quotation mark here and there.

40
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,960
Look for any error that comes back if it hints for a sequel injection and just try and exploit it.

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,510
If not, just move on to the next vulnerability type.
