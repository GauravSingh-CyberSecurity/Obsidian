00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,400
Now, let's have a look at how corn itself, when you log into Honaker one, it's going to take you

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,750
the activity page or it may take your inbox, depending on your configuration, will cover both of them

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,140
either way.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,620
But I want to talk about activity.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,270
This is one of the most valuable assets you could ever come across when it comes down to learning and

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,260
getting better at hacking.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,430
So they can see right here there are a ton of vulnerabilities that have been disclosed.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,220
You can also just filter by them right here by going to disclose.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,230
And it shows you all these different vulnerabilities by different hackers and about the amount that

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,810
they have received.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,140
So in this case, you can see this user has received a Arcy vulnerability from PayPal.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,360
Thirty thousand dollars, you can click on it.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,550
In some cases, it may be completely disclosed and some other cases you may see a link to the write

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,850
up or maybe a blurb about how this vulnerability was found.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,410
So an example, we're going to click right here.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,730
And the first example, you can see that there is a blog post.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,070
You can click on it and go read more about it and other examples.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,900
That's another one.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,900
You may actually see the vulnerability itself without having to look for it at this closed blurb right

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,050
here.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,080
So in this case for Shopify, you can see that this hacker has found a takeover on an account that doesn't

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,370
have a Shutterfly ID and more, and they've gone 23000 thousand dollars.

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,380
If you scroll down, you can see that they have given you steps to reproduce, what links to go through,

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,520
what you sign up, where do you go, what you click on and how to reproduce it.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,830
And they're giving you an impact and also a good video to show how this all works, because, again,

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,230
it looks like it's multi steps pretty complex.

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,990
So they're giving a video for it to make sure it all makes sense.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,270
And down here, you can see the conversation.

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,670
If there was charge, what questions they had and how they decided to give it twenty two point five

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,190
and then later on or sitting a thousand dollar bonus.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,600
So this is very, very valuable.

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,070
It's a very, very good tool to learn.

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,760
Can also filter test based on hackers you're following.

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,160
So, for example, if I go follow Alex right here, let's go to his page, click follow when I go back

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,460
again, because I like his work, I'm gonna look for another hacker, for example.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,020
Let's go to this one, Ron Chan, awesome hacker.

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,860
I'm going to follow him and actually go back to activity.

38
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,270
And when you scroll all the way down to the filter on the left side, you can just have it look for

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,780
hackers that you follow and it will show you all the disclosure reports.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,790
You can kind of condense what hackers are looking at.

41
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,960
And it also gives you an example.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,710
But that I found I thought process and everything that I've looked for it.
