00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,820
Now, let's talk about private invitations to for the sake of privacy and following Hakka ones code

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,290
of conduct, I can't show you the private invite and how it works, but I want to quickly talk about

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,470
them.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,150
When you get invited to a private program on hacker one, you have the chance to say yes or no.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,060
So in other words, you can say, yes, I accept this program.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm going to Harkonnen and give it a try.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,320
Or you can say, no, I do not accept, given the reason why or whether it's uninteresting, the bounty

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,400
amounts aren't good enough.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,050
That's a skill set that you don't have.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,750
Whatever the reason behind that, you want to select that reason and you want to push submit this gives

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,750
and the reason why they want to participate in this program.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,210
But what it also does is it replaces your invite with another one within 24 hours.

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,570
So if you look at a program, you don't like it, you can decline it.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,540
But ==I highly suggest accepting every single invite you get, giving it a try and then leaving the program,==

==15==
==00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,190==
==because leaving a program also gives you the opportunity to do the same thing, getting a replacement==

==16==
==00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,120==
==invitation by filling out the form.==

==17==
==00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,280==
==So in other words, if you hire on a program for three or four or five days, you're not enjoying it.==

==18==
==00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,320==
==We you can do is go down to the right bottom corner, say leave program, fill out the form the same==

==19==
==00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,730==
==way you would do it if you want to decline an invite and you would get a replacement for it within 24==

==20==
==00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,690==
==to 48 hours.==

==21==
==00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,460==
==So I highly recommend doing that cycle through your invites, find a program that you like and they==

==22==
==00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,270==
==keep hocking on it.==
