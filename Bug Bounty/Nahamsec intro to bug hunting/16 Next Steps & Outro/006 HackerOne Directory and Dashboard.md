00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,830
The next thing is the directory.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,130
It's a really good place to find a program to hack on.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,690
You want to hack on a bug bounty program?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,380
I wish you would click on offer bounties.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,410
There are companies on here that do not offer any monetary reward.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,830
They just give you points on the platform, which will give you an invite.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,940
But we'll talk about that later.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,950
But right here, you can go to offer bounties and you can select the programs that you want to hack

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,100
on.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
You can look at the average bounty.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,930
You can sort by it.

12
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,760
If you want to see the highest average bounty you can click on here, you can see that and genetics,

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,380
which is an Internet bug bounty program, pays three count average.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,480
But if you scroll down, you see a company like GitHub, GitHub, security lab pays a thousand.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,150
It's going down more.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,930
Get lab shows you one K.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,980
So that means the average bounty that I've given to hackers are about a thousand dollars.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,930
A few other things that stand out are the managed tags.

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,590
This means that how one manages this program.

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,000
So if something goes wrong, you can reach out to a hacker one directly that could help you out versus

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,130
something like which is something like down here, what it says GitHub, it's not managed by them,

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,630
doesn't make it a bad program.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,100
It just makes a different process.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,810
That means that a third party is involved like Hacker one versus the program directly does everything

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,190
on their own, but also look at the bounty minimum.

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,940
So if you want to see what programs pay the most or the least, you can click on Boundy minimum and

27
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,880
you can scroll down and look at all these different companies, how much they pay.

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,110
So, for example, GitHub, at a minimum pays six hundred and seventeen dollars.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,580
Hakobyan pays 500.

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,170
That means if you find a low vulnerability, this is the amount of money you would make.

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,970
The next thing you want to look at as a hacker dashboard, the hacker dashboard is very similar to the

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,120
directory, but it's a little bit different.

33
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,420
I'll talk through it a little bit more.

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,460
The directory is a list of all the programs on Hacker one, anything that has been indexed on hacker

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,230
one, whether or not they're hosted on hacker on itself, that means there are programs that are not

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,030
hosted on Hacker one that you can look for.

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,980
And it could give you an idea, it could give you an idea of how to get in touch with them, could also

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,780
filter these assets based on what they are safe for your mobile hacker.

39
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,370
If you want to focus on mobile hacking, you can go to Iooss if you're a hacker, which is if you want

40
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,780
to look for any Web applications that you want to go for domain, that means you have assets that are

41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,100
on the Web versus something that's an Android or Windows or a source code review.

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,900
If you go back to the hacker dashboard, if you go to my programs.

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,820
But a few different things here.

44
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,110
You can see your private programs and I'll talk about private programs later on and how to get invited

45
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,500
to them.

46
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,870
But if you want to look at a particular launch date, the number of resolve, the reports, this is

47
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,880
a better place to look at.

48
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,930
If you have private programs that you've been invited to, you can go and click on private, but you

49
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,620
can also sort them by the date you were accepted the invitation.

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,210
So that means it's a recent invite.

51
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:45,210
Or you can actually go down here and you can go up here and click on program launched it.

52
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,030
That means the most recent program based on the launch date will come up on the top.

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,320
Unfortunately for this account, I don't have an invite.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,490
One of the biggest rules of working on the hacker one platform is to never disclose the program.

55
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,030
Invitations for that reason aphthous an account that doesn't have any invitations.

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,940
But again, I just want to show you how all this works.

57
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,230
And also pending invitations shows all the invites, how you have received that you haven't responded

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,080
to, but can also send your invite preferences.

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,000
So if you go right here, click on invitation preferences, you can describe what programs you want

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
to hack on and what programs you don't want to haggle.

61
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,450
So, for example, if you want to not get invited to the programs, you can turn this off.

62
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,530
But if you want to receive invites for private programs, I highly suggest turning this on.

63
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,700
If you want to get invited to cryptocurrency programs, turn us on.

64
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,800
If you don't like hiking on, leave it off.

65
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,620
And if you also want to put a bounty preference that you want to at least have a 5.0, a minimum, one

66
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,750
hundred on minimum, you can also set that up.

67
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,040
But I think for this one to work, you also have to have some bounties already on your account to be

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,090
able to set it up right here.

69
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,010
So, again, this is later down the road when you're more comfortable with your skill sets and you want

70
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,640
to be very, very specific on what kind of programs you want to hike on.

71
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,080
But I want to make sure I cover this and make you understand you have options to turn these things on.

72
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,570
You can say no to some programs can say yes, and you can control what kind of invites you get.

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,130
Now, let's talk about invitation's itself.
