00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,960
So that was it, that was all about CSR and CSR stands for cost site request forgery, unlike exercise.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,350
You can't actually still data, but what you can do is only modify data that's on this website.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,070
So, for example, you can modify the email address, you can modify the username, password, whatever

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,900
else you're after, but you can't actually steal cookies or any data from it.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,340
When it comes to looking for sort where you want to do it, you want to make sure that you observe the

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,820
entire HGP request to see if there is any CSR efforts.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,520
Again, the location of the CSIRO took may change.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,330
Sometimes it's in a header like an ex CSR can, often in the header you can remove it and see if it

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,040
works without it.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,600
Sometimes it's pushed into these post requests so you can see a parameter called CSR underscore token

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,210
and there's a token attached to it.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,320
You can also try to move in that we can go to another user group that CSR have to account and reuse

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,610
it and see if it works.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,070
There are two different ways to exploit the CSR if it all comes down to understanding how the application

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,880
has written this mechanism to actually protect against CSR.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,700
If ==I personally don't usually report CSRf because the impact is sometimes unclear.==

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,720
But if you're looking for CSR, I highly recommend looking at functionality.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,850
That's a very, very critical things, like changing a password, maybe changing the user name, changing

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,490
an email address, things that could have a high impact.

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,100
You can also report low impact CSR, but the bounty amount for those things might be a lot lower than

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,230
something that could lead into an account take over.
