I like to usually use as DNS, DNS, Djenne allows you to generate their phone permutation of a same

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,590
website.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,680
What it does is it will take a number of keywords from you and it will throw it in the subdomains.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,020
For example, in this case, we're using partner mail, Cyclopes courtyard, dot com, and it's taking

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,060
those keywords backstage pass.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,600
And you can see that it's adding somewhere in here and it's looking to see if it's other permutations

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,010
exist.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,150
So for another example, to make it very simple, as if I'm looking at Melda Yahoo dot com, can I find

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,780
Mel Deve, Mel Dash Dev and that sort of other permutations or environments that the developers may

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,740
be using to extend our attack surface.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,610
So let's look at installing this.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,710
It looks like it's a super simple install.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,400
All you have to do is use three.

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,490
So we're going to go ahead and type that in.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,650
And this is going to insult the nation for us.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm going to give it a sec and once it's done, we're going to give it a try.
