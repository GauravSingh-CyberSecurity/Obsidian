00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,860
So this first application, as we talk, is going to check if something has in stock, we're going to

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,330
click on it.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,650
It comes back and says, hey, 43 items in stock.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,260
But let's actually see what happens when we click this.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,220
So we're going to do here is we're going to open up our network tab here within Dev Chrome tools.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,080
You can do this again by right clicking and going to inspect Gogia Network.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,820
We're going to click check stock in the back and we see that it's actually making a request to product

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,910
ID equals one using stock check.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,430
How are we going to do is we're going to just give it less.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,060
As you can see right here, it says uploads.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,530
So that means that's probably what the folder we have in here.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,330
The next thing we can do is we can run one of the commands that we had in our previous example in our

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,750
slides.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,360
So as we do PubMed, you can see right now it says the folder we're working in.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,570
And of course, we can try the command for ID.

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,800
This comes back and tells us what user we are running this command line.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,640
As I explained earlier, it tells us about the user, the group here and and the numerical ID for it

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:07,200
at last, but not least is the you name, which we can do you name A, which tells us about this operating

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,070
system because some basic information was it last updated and so on.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,700
So again, this is a very simple way of doing this.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,330
So happen.

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,910
There are very, very common to happen.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,900
You just have to find the right place to do it and you have to just make sure you have almost every

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,180
application or every parameter that you may think could be vulnerable to a command injection.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,500
And of course, as I mentioned in my last slide, there doesn't have to always be a semicolon.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,170
There could be other ways of ending a command.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,120
We can actually do this.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,230
We can do it and sign a pipe to learn, say, pipe inside.

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,020
And you can see it's going to ignore the previous command and give us the output for a second one,

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,830
which is ID.

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,530
Or again, it could be any other commands that we have covered.
