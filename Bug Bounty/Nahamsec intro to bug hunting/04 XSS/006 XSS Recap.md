00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,820
So that was excess exercise for Crosseyed, scripting their different ways of finding excesses, including

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,280
reflected Stewart and DOM excesses, which we covered in our entire chapter for this one.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,140
And then we're going to talk about how to look for it again, when you're looking for crosshatch scripting.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,300
My advice to you is to put in an e-mail tag first looking into the source of the application and making

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,040
sure that you can find the text or the e-mail title you put into the application and then seeing the

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,070
context of where your text is going to say from the script tag, the approach is different versus being

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,270
in a title or a hidden input field to you want to make sure you look for that e-mail thing that you

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,840
put in there.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,750
For example, I always do a underline opening to you, closing time test.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,460
One, two, three.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,930
I open up the Web source.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,940
I go through the Google network tab or the inspector tab for test one, two, three and see for every

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,160
single place a test one, two, three has shown up and then try to exploit it depending on where it

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,700
shows up.

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,710
And using exercice, what you can do is you can see what cookies can change email addresses, you can

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,900
change passwords and whatever else can.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,080
Also still a SRF token if there is a sort of implementations on there to make sure you can successfully

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,330
edit the content of someone's account.

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,060
And when it comes down to stealing cookies or a session, you can always send that to your server,

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,120
copy paste the cookie value into your browser and log in as that user.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,080
This may not happen every single time because of the application and how they'll run it and what measures

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,860
or what security measures they have in place.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,380
But there's always a possibility of having that session cookie stored on your server and sending it

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,940
to yourself to log in as that user.
