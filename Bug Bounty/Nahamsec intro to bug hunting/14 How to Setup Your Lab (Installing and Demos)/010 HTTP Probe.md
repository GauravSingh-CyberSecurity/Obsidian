00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,070
The next thing we're going to install is HTTP probe, one of my most favorite tools to use while the Recon,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,330
the great thing about HTTP Probe is that it actually tells you which one of your targets, let's say,

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,550
you have collected from the other tools or other sources which ones are actually online and you can

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,260
access them.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,940
So we're going to go ahead and install it again, since this is a tool and then go insolation should

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,790
be fairly easy.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,850
All you have to do is to go get and install this tool for us later down the line.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,800
When you watch the recon labs, if you are watching already, you probably have seen me use it by later

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,310
down the line.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,300
You're going to see how we use HTP probe to make sure we only get a list of available assets when it

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,600
comes down to a large target with a bug bounty program.
