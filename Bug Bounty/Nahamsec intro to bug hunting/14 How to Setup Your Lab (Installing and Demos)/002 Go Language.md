00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,190
Now we're looking to our virtual private server.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,450
We're going to install a few things, first thing we want to do as we want to install the go language.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,290
If you already know how to do this, go ahead and skip this section.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,740
You may not need it, but we're going to install go.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,260
So lucky for us, the Ocean has a great article on how to install go on your server.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,410
It's a little bit outdated right now.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,360
Go as all the way to a 15 version, not 10.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,570
But we're going to go ahead and just make this adjustment in our Kerl.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,340
So I'm going to put this out at 15 one.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,560
I'm going to put this has 15 one.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,060
We're going to go ahead and download it.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,760
Once it's downloaded, we're going to go down here.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,150
So we're going to go ahead and extract the contents of our thaat file and just make sure you have the

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,670
right version in there, is going to unpack it.

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,720
And we're going to do next is we're going to move it to our user local folder.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,620
Now that we have done this, the last thing we want to do is you want to make sure we copy this bit

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,040
and add it to our profile adult profile file to make sure we define where is our gopalnath and where

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,530
is the executable for our go.

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,360
So once we have done this, we're going to say this file, we're going to type in source profile.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,470
Which of these changes going to affect this and make sure everything has been set up properly.

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,790
What we're going to do next, what we're going to do next is typing go and version.

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,670
It's going to come back and say fifteen point one, which is the version that was downloaded and installed

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,840
on our box.
