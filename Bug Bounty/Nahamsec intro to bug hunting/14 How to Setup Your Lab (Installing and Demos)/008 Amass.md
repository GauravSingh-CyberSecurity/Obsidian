**1**  
One of my favorite tools to use for reconnaissance is **Amass**.

**2**  
This is a powerful tool.

**3**  
It can do a lot of things.

**4**  
It looks for DNS records and performs scraping through various search engines.

**5**  
It also looks at certificates.

**6**  
Amass integrates different APIs.

**7**  
It checks archive data.

**8**  
It’s a very, very cool tool.

**9**  
It supports multiple operating systems.

**10**  
We're going to go ahead and perform a basic demonstration.

**11**  
It's pretty easy to install, but Amass has a wide range of features.

**12**  
I highly recommend checking out the tutorials and understanding what it does because this tool goes far beyond just subdomain enumeration.

**13**  
We'll cover several of its use cases here.

**14**  
Jeff Foley, the creator of Amass, has also given an excellent talk at NahamCon.

**15**  
I'll make sure to link it in the resources section below.

**16**  
You should check it out to understand how professionals use Amass for reconnaissance on different targets.

**17**  
There are several ways to install Amass.

**18**  
If you're using Docker, you can install it via Docker.

**19**  
Alternatively, you can download the source code and compile it yourself.

**20**  
We're going to follow the easiest method for installation.

**21**  
It's not overly complex — we’ll use a simple `apt-get` install.

**22**  
Let’s go ahead and run:

```
sudo apt-get install amass
```

**23**  
That should install it. If it doesn’t, I’ll show an alternative.

**24**  
You can also try installing it with `snap`.

**25**  
There are plenty of ways to install this tool.

**26**  
The key point is to ensure you have it installed — whether through Snap or APT, it should work.

**27**  
Snap is doing its job here, and Amass should be ready in a minute.

**28**  
Once installed, you can run Amass.

**29**  
Amass is a massive tool with a wide range of capabilities.

**30**  
Each module or option has its own set of features.

**31**  
Again, it’s a huge tool — honestly, Amass alone could have an entire course dedicated to it.

**32**  
For this section of the course, though, we’ll just explore a few features.

**33**  
But I highly recommend diving deeper into Amass and exploring additional tutorials.

**34**  
Daniel Miessler has written an excellent article on Amass.

**35**  
I'll include it in the resources section below as well.

**36**  
Also, ==Jeff Foley, the creator of Amass, gave a great talk at NahamCon about using Amass efficiently.==

==I’ll make sure to link all these resources below so you can explore and learn from them.==
