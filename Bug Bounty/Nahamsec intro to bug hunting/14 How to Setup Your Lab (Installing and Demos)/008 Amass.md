00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,780
One of my favorite tools to ever use for Rickon as a mouse.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,660
This is a massive tool.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,780
It does a lot of stuff.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,980
It looks for DNS records and some scraping through different search engines.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,090
It looks at certificate's.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
It has different APIs.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,450
It looks at archives.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,070
It's a very, very cool tool.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,400
It comes with different supports for different OS.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,600
We're going to go ahead and look for a bone to show.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,190
You were pretty easy to install, but this does a lot of stuff.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,980
I highly, highly recommend looking at the tutorials and understanding what it does because this is

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,900
just beyond just subdominant numeration, but we're going to cover a lot of the different usages for

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,080
it.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,800
Jeff Foy, the author of Lost a Mouse, also has done a great talk during the Hong Kong.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,700
I'll make sure to link it down below and the resource sections.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,270
And you can kind of look at it, understand how users amass to do recon on different targets.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,210
So to install this, you can do a bunch of different ways.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,440
If you're using Docker, you can use a docker way of it can do it from source.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,670
If you want to download the source and compile on your own, we're going to do the easiest way to do

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,310
it.

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,530
And it's not a craft or just using a picture you get.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,110
So we're just going to go ahead and just to get in a mouse and that should actually do it.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,090
And if that doesn't work, I could put it on my screen.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,380
We can try doing SNOP.

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,390
There's a ton of different ways of doing this.

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,640
Again, I just have to make sure you got installed like SNOP is doing its thing.

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,630
It's going to install it for us in a minute and we should be good to go now.

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,080
I'm able to install it is going to open a mouse again.

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,830
Hamas as a huge tool, can do a ton of different things with it.

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,150
So all the different options within each of these, it has its own options.

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,590
Again, it's a huge tool.

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,970
I feel like Hamas itself could have the cause of the course of its own.

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,890
But for the sake of this portion of the course, we're just going to try out a few things.

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,220
But I highly recommend using a mouse looking into different tutorials.

36
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,040
Daniel Missler has done a great article on this.

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,120
I'll make sure to link it down below in our research sections, as I mentioned earlier.

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,590
And also Jeff Foley, the author of Hamas, has also done a great talk, Nahum Khan, on how to use

39
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,670
a mouse efficiently.

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,060
I'll make sure I have all these links down below and you can go ahead and use them.
