00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,470
So next thing I want to install and nmap , in order for any nmap to work, you want to make sure that your

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,970
apt is updated.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,270
```
So are we going to do is type in sudo apt update and get an update?
```

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,590
This should be the first thing you do when you create a new server.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,140
We're going to give it a few seconds, is going to be done soon.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,030
And once that is done, we can use apt to install our own nmap.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,140
Now it says it's done.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,130
We can do upgrade.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,270
I'm going to skip it.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,160
And we just typing `sudo apt install  map.`
