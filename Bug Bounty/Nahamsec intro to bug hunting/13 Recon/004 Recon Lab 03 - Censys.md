Now, let's have a look at Censys "Censys.io" is another really great tool to look for further subdomains or assets belonging to a company. You would actually need to register an account for free.
I highly recommend it. Even though they give you partial results and not the whole data, it’s still very worth looking into.

You can download this. You can actually visit this by going to their search. You can search for the IP space by typing in a domain name.

For example, we’re going to do **gm.com** now. We start looking at every IP address that has GM within it. You can filter based on the open ports.

You can look at the tags. You can look at the number of who owns this IP.

So you can go to **General Motors**, for example, and narrow down your search. This will show you all these domains.

You can also look for certificates. So, this right here shows **443, 443 certificate paths** where the DNS name matches GM.

We're going to copy this, type it into our search, and we’re going to get **gm.com**.

And that’s also going to bring up all these different certificates that belong to GM. Some of these may be accessible, while others may not be.

You’d have to automate some of this or manually check them out.

You could also expand this to look at all these certificates, but some of them may not be accessible. However, you can type in **GM** and pull a list of all the assets with a certificate attached to them belonging to **gm.com**.

You can see a list of them right here, and it will give them all to you.

You can also look at their API. Again, **Censys is very powerful**.

I have personally been able to find some really cool vulnerabilities on assets that were identified solely on Censys.

Again, it's a **very, very useful tool**. I highly recommend looking into it.

Their documentation is also very good.

You can type in **443**, for example. Let’s go back to the **IPv4 space** really quickly.

By filtering for **443**, you can see all the different domain names.

Another thing you can do is look at the **issuer for the certificate**.

So, whoever has issued this certificate—if GM itself has issued it—it will come up, though I don’t think they issue their own certificates.

We can also look at past names, subject names, and other related details.

00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,610
Now, let's have a look at census, census is another really great tool to look for further subdomains

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,740
or As'ad belonging to a company would actually need to register an account for free.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,730
I highly recommend it.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,500
Even though they give you a partial result, they don't give you the whole data.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,480
So very worth it to look into it.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,390
You can download this.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,520
You can actually visit this by going to their search.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,890
You can actually search for the IP for space by typing in a domain name, for example.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,200
We're going to do GM dotcom now.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,010
We started looking at every IP address that has GM within it.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,440
You can filter based on the port.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,830
No, that's open.

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,210
You can look at the tags.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,950
You can look at a number which are there's a number of who owns this IP.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,170
So you can go to General Motors, for example, and narrow down your search and show you all these domains

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,080
can also look for certificates.

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,440
So this right here that shows right here, four, four, three, four, four, three certificate pass

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,720
where the DNS name matches GM.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,040
We're going to copy this, type it into our search and we're going to give a GM dot com.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,420
And that's also going to bring all these different certificates that belong to GM.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,970
Some of these may be accessible, so that may not be accessible.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,000
You'd have to automate some of this or manually check them out.

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,160
Could also expand this to look at all these certificates.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,650
But some of these may not be accessible, but you can type in GM and put a list of all of the assets

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,070
with a certificate attached to it belonging to GM dot com.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,070
And you can see a list of them right here and we'll give them to you all.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
You can also look at their API.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,730
Again, Sensis is also very powerful.

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,040
I personally have been able to find some really cool horns on some assets that were identified solely

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,180
on census.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,620
Again, very, very cultural.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,490
I highly recommend looking into it and they're very, very good at documenting.

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,530
And you can type in four for three, for example.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,650
And here let's go back to the IP before space really quick.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,410
I mean, for for three, it could show you all the different names.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,400
The other thing that you can do is you can actually look at the issuer for ID.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,810
So whoever has issued this.

38
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,690
So if GM itself has issued this, it will come up, which I don't think they have issued their own certificate.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,180
We can look at the past names, subject name and so on.
