So, recon is very, very useful, but it all depends on the program you're talking about. Every program requires the same kind of approach as we have shown in these slides.

For example, if you're hacking on a program that allows you to just look at their main core application, which is [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/), you want to make sure that you change the methodology for recon so that it works with their scope.

First of all, you have to make sure you understand the scope. Look at it. If it says, "Hey, only our main applications," and if you want to do recon based on one single application, dive into JavaScript files, look for those hidden endpoints, and see if you can exploit them.

In cases like Verizon, Media, Google, Facebook — when they tell you, "Hey, everything we own is in scope, every domain and subdomain," for example, facebook.com/* is in scope — then you want to do your content discovery and asset discovery. Look for subdomains, directory brute force, open ports, do some screenshotting, and make sure you have a complete zoomed-out view of this entire organization.

Start picking targets based on the keywords like "staging," "API," or whatever else is intriguing to your interest that you think you may be able to find a vulnerability in by pulling up that website.

So Rickon is very, very useful, but it all depends on the program you're talking about, every program

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,310
requires the same kind of approach as we have shown in these slides.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,850
So, for example, if you're hiking on a program that allows you to just look out their main core application,

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,670
which is a dub dub, dub, dot com, for example, you want to make sure that you change the methodology

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,840
for Rickon, that it works with their scope.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,230
So first of all, you have to make sure you understand the scope.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:25,910
Look at it.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,860
If it says, hey, only our main applications and if you want to do a recon based on one single application,

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,830
dive into JavaScript files, look for those hidden endpoints and see if you can exploit them.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,360
And in cases like Verizon, media on Google, Facebook, when they tell you, hey, everything we own

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,620
is in scope, every every domain and something on there.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,760
For example, Facebook dot com is in the scope.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,530
Then you want to do your content discovery and as a discovery, look for subdomains, directory brute

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,560
force, look for open ports, do some screen shotting and make sure you have a complete zoomed out view

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,010
of this entire organization and start picking targets based on the keywords like the staging API or

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,520
whatever.

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,320
That's intriguing to your interest that you think you may be able to find a vulnerability in by pulling

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,980
up that website.
