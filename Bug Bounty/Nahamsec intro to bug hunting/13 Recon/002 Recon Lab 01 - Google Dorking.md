00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,660
Now, let's look at Google when it comes down to Dorking, Google Dorking is very, very important.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,150
We're going to look at GM.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,600
They are a free vulnerability disclosure program on Hocker one.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,310
You can check them out by going to hacker one dot com stocks, GM in their scope right now.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,220
It states had everything that they own digitally is a part of their program.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,780
So what we're going to do is we're going to type in site and we're going to tap into domains.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,160
GM dot com is their domain.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,640
We're going to say site GM dot com.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,440
And this brings every single you out the has the site GM dot com in it.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,380
So now we can see that the GM dot com is being repeated a bunch of times.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,260
So we're going to go up there and exclude it by doing a dash as hard as you can see as as gone.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,900
The next one we want to exclude as search careers.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,010
We're going to go copy it or just type it in search careers and can put it in quotations like this that

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,030
also makes it go away.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,310
So you can see now that's gone.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,890
I can keep doing this by taking over the WWE domain name came up and keep extending this until you're

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,010
out of subdomains and you can see there are a ton of them.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,770
They can also extend this by looking at extensions.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,840
This is file extensions.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,820
So if I want to look for PSP files, I can type in B if you open it, you can see that this file has

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,450
something would be interested in it.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,050
Same thing here or here.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,440
And there's with any extensions you can look for zip files, you can look for a GSB, you can look for

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,470
whatever one you want, can also look for actual file names.

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,410
If you want to look for anything that has the keyword admin in there, you are all you can type it in,

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,610
I think there.

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,980
What about login, which is a good one to look at.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,840
So this brings on login for system login.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,350
This you can actually xmen by doing entries I got once gone medius back up and you can type it in like

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,950
this again.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,150
The other thing you can do also is you can look for titles so you can say whatever has the title admitting

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,230
it, bring it up, nothing there.

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,610
I type in, log in.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,180
It's entitled entitled actually it is entitled.

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,520
So it looks like entitled brought up log in.

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,530
You can type in admin and see if there's any admin stuff coming out.

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,830
It's really, really powerful, especially if you're looking at a fresh new target or a website that

38
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,810
has a lot of digital assets.

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,250
I highly, highly recommend learning how to do more with Google, but those are the most basic ones

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,310
and the most valuable ones that I've seen hackers use and including myself and I go to any time I'm

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,680
looking for a bug bounty program that's brand new or I want to do some research on what their assets

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,270
looks like or what kind of domains they have and so on.

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,830
Can also look for def sites by typing in your URL and giving it to keyword Dev.

44
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,730
And as you can see, this came up with Dev, that GM dot com, which has a sign in for it, can also

45
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,420
do stuff like Kuai if there are any Kuai, if there are any, if there are any Q8 sites or anywhere,

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,100
has the word kit anywhere has a word cute anywhere as the keyword Kuai or bring it up as well.

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,180
So again, Google is very, very powerful.

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,260
It's one of the first things I do when it comes down to hacking on a brand new target that I've never

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,740
hacked on.
