Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you can’t customize hosts inside a server or environment? Or, more realistically, have you ever been tired of creating custom hosts on your machine to resolve some tedious domains to IP addresses like this?

```
192.168.56.25 website_1  
192.168.56.26 website_2  
192.168.56.27 website_3  
192.168.56.28 website_4
```

It’s necessary and useful to do so as it’s easier to type project1 instead of a long IP address. However, in some special cases, it’s critical to resolve a domain to an IP address from a real DNS. Owning a domain to achieve such a goal is an option, but what if you don’t want to spend money on it? xip.io comes to the rescue.

# What is xip.io?

xip.io is a simple solution that provides free wildcard DNS resolution for any IP address. It’s widely used in development environments, such as when you’re working on the implementation of self-signed certificates, which require a domain that’s allowed on the certificate. In this case, xip.io can be used to meet the requirement. Additionally, when your application needs to handle subdomains, xip.io can also help.

# How does it work?

xip.io operates a custom DNS server on the public internet. When your computer looks up a xip.io domain, the xip.io DNS server extracts the IP address from the domain and sends it back in the response.
```

            10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1  
        www.10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1  
  mywebsite.10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1  
app.project.10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1  
       192.168.56.24.xip.io   resolves to   192.168.56.24

```
xip.io is a simple and effective solution that can save you time and money. It’s a must-have tool in your development arsenal that will help you achieve seamless wildcard DNS resolution for any IP address.
