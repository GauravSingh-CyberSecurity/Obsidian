SSRF is one of my absolute favorite vulnerabilities to look for. Not only is it a critical or high-severity vulnerability, but it also often has the highest payout in bug bounty programs. It's also really fun to find because there are endless ways to exploit it. However, it all comes down to deeply understanding how it works, how the application functions, and then combining that knowledge to identify the vulnerability.

For this specific type of SSRF, I highly recommend looking for integrations, webhooks, or any feature that allows you to input a URL. Point the URL to your own server and check if the request to your server is made from the client side or the server side. If the request is coming from an IP that doesnâ€™t belong to you, or if it's an IP associated with the company or their cloud provider, you may have found an SSRF vulnerability.

When it comes to SSRF, the biggest areas to target are internal networks and cloud metadata services. You can conduct reconnaissance to find out where internal services are hosted and attempt to query them. Alternatively, you can target cloud metadata services (such as AWS metadata endpoints) to extract sensitive information like instance credentials.

SSRF comes in different forms. It can be **blind SSRF**, **full-response SSRF**, or **limited-response SSRF**. If you notice that a request is coming from a server, experiment with itâ€”figure out what data you have access to and how you can demonstrate its impact. When reporting SSRF vulnerabilities, proving the full impact is essential for maximizing your bounty and ensuring the security team understands the severity of the issue.

a critical or high vulnerability, it's the most pay-out in some cases, but it also becomes really,

really fun.

There's endless ways I find it necessary, but it all comes down to really deeply understanding how

one type specifically, I highly recommend looking for integration's web hook, anything that actually

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,960
allows you to feel that you are URL and pointing it to your server and seeing if the request to your

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,000
server is being made client side or server side as the IP address that's making the request doesn't

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,950
belong to you or is a random IP that belongs to this company or it's coming from the AWB or the cloud

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,730
in the sense that the company is using and it comes to SRF.
