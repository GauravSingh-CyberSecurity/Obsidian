| 1     | 18-Mar-25 | Harrier    | {username}  | LOW  | Clear text transmission of username                  | The application transmits usernames in clear text over the network. This means that during authentication or other data exchanges, the username is not encrypted or protected via HTTPS/TLS, making it vulnerable to interception by attackers through network sniffing or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. | An attacker monitoring the network traffic could easily capture user credentials, leading to unauthorized access to accounts and potentially sensitive user data. This compromises user privacy and increases the risk of account takeovers. | Ensure that all communications, especially login forms, are secured using HTTPS/TLS to encrypt usernames and passwords during transmission.                        |

 * Absence of Verification and Rate limit of OTP (Severity: High)
 * Absence of SSL Pinning in the Application (Severity: High)
 * Account Activation Code Bypass (Severity: Critical)
 * Email Flooding (No Rate Limit) (Severity: Medium)

 * Root Detection Not Implemented (Severity: Medium)
 * Hardcoded Email Address (Severity: Medium)



DAST vulnerability:
In BML: when user change pw , the qr code when scanned that generates otp in MS Auth,the otp is invalid.
Root cause: qr code was created using password set by user, when password is changed by user, the qr code become invalid.
Fixed: by using email ID to generate qr, since email id is static and can't be changed.

VAPT vulnerability:
1) BNHS: found admin panel url, public facing (i.e on open internet ) by directory fuzzing/dirbusting/ dir browsing 
The admin panel had a register function that take email and send password on email.
When used the email and password recieved in inbox.
I was able to login in admin panel and was able to edit the whole , website.
Add blogs, delete blogs . I had full control over admin privileges.
(This was a major broken authentication vulnerability )
CVSS score: 10.0 (critical)

2) Paytonic: merchant dashboard, I was able to change user pw by , bruteforcing the generate OTP (input otp field) , I did this by employing other vulnerability like , on login page(which uses mob no. and password )no rate limiting on login or generate OTP(for forgot pw) page .etc, error disclosing if Mobile number is correct or not , finding mobile number through error message and using  it to generate OTP, otp functionality doesn't send otp on mobile number(i.e not working creating a DOS scenario), but I thought probably in backend OTP is generated for comparison of user inputting OTP, so since no rate limiting I did bruteforcing on OTP for all possible 6 digit number and found OTP then used OTP to change user password,
   I was able to change a user password without being and authorised user and since generate OTP(for forgot password  functionality ) does not send otp to Users mobile number, user can't even use forgot PW to get their account back. And I have full control.
   (Broken Authentication, information disclosure, No rate limiting, DOS since otp not sent to user, leading to permanent account takeover)
   CVSS score: 9.8 critical.
