# Exact Methodology for Selecting and Approaching Bug Bounty Programs

**Main Takeaway:** A systematic, data-driven approach to choosing and engaging in bug bounty programs maximizes impact, efficiency, and earnings while ensuring ethical compliance and continuous skill development.

***

## 1. Define Your Objectives and Skill Profile

Before selecting any program, clarify your personal goals and current capabilities.

1.1. Purpose and Motivation  
  -  Earnings – Target programs with lucrative bounty ranges.  
  -  Learning – Focus on new technologies or frameworks.  
  -  Reputation – Seek programs with hall-of-fame or public disclosure.  

1.2. Skills Inventory  
  -  Technical Proficiencies: List all programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), protocol knowledge (e.g., HTTP, WebSockets), and exploit styles (e.g., XSS, SSRF, SQLi).  
  -  Toolchain Comfort: Note familiarity with Burp Suite, Fiddler, custom scripts, fuzzers.  
  -  Time Availability: Estimate hours per week for reconnaissance, testing, and reporting.  

1.3. Gap Analysis  
  -  Identify weak areas (e.g., mobile reverse-engineering) and set study milestones.  
  -  Enroll in targeted CTF challenges or tutorials to shore up gaps before tackling advanced programs.

## 2. Market Research: Identify and Rank Potential Programs

Conduct thorough program research to build a ranked list that aligns with your objectives.

2.1. Data Sources  
  -  Aggregate program directories (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti).  
  -  Community-curated lists (GitHub, Bug Bounty Forum).  
  -  Public hall-of-fame pages for payout statistics.  

2.2. Selection Criteria and Weighting  
| Criterion                  | Description                                                                    | Weight (%) |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Payout Potential           | Average and maximum bounties per vulnerability class                           | 30         |
| Program Scope Breadth      | Number of assets in scope (web, mobile, API, IoT)                              | 20         |
| Program Reputation         | Transparency of triage process, timeliness of bounties, communication clarity  | 15         |
| Asset Familiarity          | Overlap with your technical strengths (stack, frameworks)                      | 15         |
| Competition Density        | Number of active researchers vs. payout volume                                 | 10         |
| Safe Harbor & Policies     | Clarity of rules, prohibited testing methods, and legal assurances             | 10         |

2.3. Create a Program Scorecard  
  -  Build a spreadsheet with columns for each criterion.  
  -  Assign scores (1–5) and multiply by weight.  
  -  Rank programs by aggregate weighted score.

## 3. Deep-Dive Reconnaissance

Once top candidates are chosen, perform exhaustive information gathering.

3.1. Asset Enumeration  
  -  Passive Discovery: Use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools—Amass, Sublist3r—to collect subdomains, IP ranges.  
  -  Active Scanning: Nmap, Masscan to map live hosts and open ports.  

3.2. Technology Profiling  
  -  Fingerprint frameworks via Wappalyzer or custom headers.  
  -  Identify API endpoints, SOAP/WSDL, GraphQL schemas.  
  -  Document JavaScript libraries and versions for known CVEs.

3.3. Business Logic Mapping  
  -  Diagram user flows: registration, login, transaction, password reset.  
  -  Enumerate roles and authorization boundaries.  
  -  List all parameters, entry points, and potential trust boundaries.

## 4. Vulnerability Hypothesis and Prioritization

Frame test hypotheses based on reconnaissance outcomes.

4.1. Threat Modeling  
  -  STRIDE approach: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial, Elevation.  
  -  Attack trees for high-value targets (e.g., financial transactions, admin panels).  

4.2. Hypothesis List  
  -  XSS in feedback widget due to outdated editor library.  
  -  SSRF via open-redirect parameter on image proxy.  
  -  JWT forging with weak signing algorithm.  

4.3. Risk and Reward Matrix  
  -  Probability vs. Impact chart: prioritize medium-probability, high-impact cases first.  
  -  Factor in bounty ranges for each class to maximize ROI on testing time.

***

## 5. Structured Testing Workflow

Implement a disciplined, repeatable testing process for each hypothesis.

5.1. Environment Setup  
  -  Authentication chaining: script cookie capture, token refresh.  
  -  Proxy configuration: point Burp, ZAP, or mitmproxy; integrate custom Python intercept scripts.  

5.2. Test Execution  
  -  Automated scanning: run tailored Burp extensions (e.g., active scan with custom payload lists).  
  -  Manual verification: leverage triple-encode, unicode, and null-byte tricks for edge cases.  
  -  Fuzzing: target JSON parsers, XML endpoints, HTTP headers with boofuzz or custom scripts.  

5.3. Result Documentation  
  -  Harvest request/response pairs with full headers and bodies.  
  -  Screen recordings or terminal logs showing proof of concept (PoC).  
  -  Impact assessment: describe data exposure, integrity violation, or service disruption.

## 6. Reporting with Maximum Clarity

Craft clear, concise, and reproducible vulnerability reports.

6.1. Report Structure  
  1. **Title**: “Authenticated Stored XSS via Rich-Text Editor”  
  2. **Executive Summary**: One-sentence impact overview.  
  3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Numbered, verbatim cURL or browser actions.  
  4. **PoC**: Minimal code snippet or video screenshot.  
  5. **Impact**: Explain business or technical risk.  
  6. **Remediation**: Patches, configuration changes, or third-party updates.  
  7. **References**: CVE links, OWASP pages.  

6.2. Communication Best Practices  
  -  Use program’s preferred template or Markdown.  
  -  Label attachments clearly (e.g., PoC_video.mp4, request_01.txt).  
  -  Be polite, avoid accusatory language.  

***

## 7. Triage Follow-Up and Payout Negotiation

Ensure timely resolution and fair compensation.

7.1. Triage Engagement  
  -  Acknowledge receipt promptly.  
  -  Provide clarifications if the triage team requests additional details.  

7.2. Severity and Bounty Negotiation  
  -  If severity is downgraded, back up your assessment with OWASP or CVSS v3.1 rationale.  
  -  Suggest bounty range based on program’s historical payout data.  

7.3. Disclosure and Hall of Fame  
  -  Adhere to disclosure timelines.  
  -  Submit write-ups for public recognition if permitted.

## 8. Continuous Improvement

Refine your methodology and skillset iteratively.

8.1. Post-Engagement Review  
  -  Log time spent per vulnerability vs. bounty received.  
  -  Identify process bottlenecks (e.g., slow scanning phases).  

8.2. Knowledge Sharing  
  -  Contribute to community tools and write blog posts.  
  -  Participate in peer code reviews of disclosed bugs.  

8.3. Skill Advancement  
  -  Stay current on new CVEs and proof-of-concept trends.  
  -  Master emerging domains: smart contracts, machine-learning APIs, edge computing.
