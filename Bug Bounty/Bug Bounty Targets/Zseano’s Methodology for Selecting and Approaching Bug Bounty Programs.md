Zseano methodologies to pick programs

# Zseano’s Methodology for Selecting and Approaching Bug Bounty Programs

Zseano’s award-winning approach emphasizes **depth over breadth**. Rather than “spray-and-pray” across many targets, he picks a single program and masters its entire scope. Below is his step-by-step roadmap for choosing—and consistently finding bugs in—the right programs:

## 1. Program Selection Criteria  
1. **Broad, Evolving Scope**  
   - Wildcard domains (`*.example.com`) or multiple sub-applications  
   - Regularly updated features or micro-apps (e.g., analytics, payments)  
2. **Fair, Consistent Payouts**  
   - Medium-severity bounties ≥ \$200–\$500 to justify time investment  
3. **Developer Responsiveness**  
   - Platforms or programs with fast triage and active security teams  
4. **Lower Competition**  
   - Newly launched or recently expanded programs  
   - Regional/smaller platforms (e.g., Intigriti) alongside HackerOne/Bugcrowd  

## 2. “Foot in the Door”: Initial Recon  
1. **What’s Available**  
   - Enumerate all user roles and entry points (normal user vs. manager/admin)  
   - Map out every page, API endpoint, and hidden parameter  
2. **How It Works**  
   - Walk through each workflow manually: registration, login, data submission, payment flows  
   - Capture requests/responses, observe input validation and filter inconsistencies  
3. **Common Patterns & Filters**  
   - Identify where filters differ (e.g., XSS blocked in one param but allowed in another)  
   - Note reusable parameters, cookie handling, CSRF tokens, rate limits  

## 3. Deep Focus & Iteration  
1. **Master One Program**  
   - Spend weeks “living” in the same scope; revisit after each update  
   - Treat the program as your personal ATM—new features often repeat past mistakes  
2. **Automate What You Understand**  
   - Build small scripts or Nuclei templates to re-test known payloads across endpoints  
   - Automate subdomain/endpoint enumeration but validate findings manually  
3. **Bug Mounting Mindset**  
   - Each confirmed bug reveals developer blind spots—chase those patterns elsewhere in scope  
   - Leverage every discovery to hypothesize next flaws (e.g., if XSS found in comments, test it in profile fields)  

## 4. Automation Roadmap  
- **Continuous Tasks**: Subdomain enumeration (Amass, Subfinder), endpoint discovery (httpx), low-severity templates (Nuclei)  
- **One-Time Tasks**: Targeted fuzzing of newly discovered parameters (ffuf, custom scripts)  
- **Orchestration**: Use message queues (RabbitMQ) + containerized workers (Go for speed, Python for flexibility)  
- **Alerting**: Push new asset or vulnerability findings via Slack/Discord/webhooks for immediate manual follow-up  

## 5. Sustaining Momentum  
- **Program Watch**: Monitor GitHub commit feeds or platform announcement channels for scope changes  
- **Community Intel**: Follow Zseano’s Twitter/Discord streams and “Bug Bounty Radar” newsletters  
- **Mindset Breaks**: When stuck, step away—fresh perspectives often reveal logic flaws you previously missed  

***

By **choosing the right programs**—those with broad, dynamic scopes and fair medium-level payouts—and by **immersing yourself deeply** in a single target, Zseano consistently uncovers overlooked vulnerabilities. This disciplined, iterative focus differentiates top hunters from the “spray-and-pray” crowd.
