current skill level and primary expertise web testing, API testing, , business logic, mobile testing but not for the client side


How many hours per week can you dedicate to bug bounty reconnaissance and testing:
:- you tell me, I have an 8hr 5day per week vapt job as well



Which platforms do you already use or prefer (I use:-HackerOne, Bugcrowd), but again you tell me.



Are you focused on public programs with monetary rewards, or are VDPs (non-reward) acceptable for practice?
: create separate roadmap for vdp and bug bounty, but I am more interested in earning.



Do you have preferred industries or target sizes (e-commerce, financial services, small startups, large tech): you tell me 


Would you like to automate initial enumeration (wordlists, scripts) or rely primarily on manual exploration?
i want to automate it all, also would like manual side by side to understand.

# Tailored Roadmap to Maximize Low- and Medium-Severity Bug Finds

Leveraging your expertise in web, API, business logic, and mobile testing (excluding client-side), this dual roadmap balances **monetary bug bounties** with **VDP practice**, integrating full automation pipelines and manual deep dives.

***

## 1. Time Allocation  
- **Total Weekly Time**: ~6 hours  
  - **Automated Recon & Monitoring**: 4 hours  
  - **Manual Validation & Logic Testing**: 2 hours  

***

## 2. Platform Selection  
- **Primary Bug Bounty Platforms**: HackerOne, Bugcrowd  
- **Supplementary**: Intigriti (lower competition), YesWeHack (Europe-focused)  
- **VDP Practice Platforms**: Bugcrowd VDPs, Intigriti VDPs, YesWeHack VDPs  

***

## 3. Industry & Program Size Focus  
- **E-commerce & SMBs**: Standard flows, immature security → more logic bugs  
- **Fintech & APIs**: Complex auth/authorization and transaction logic  
- **New Programs & Startups**: Early scopes, fewer hunters, broad wildcards  
- **Avoid**: Mega-tech public giants (over-hardened, high competition)  

***

## 4. Automation Framework  
1. **Scope Retrieval**  
   - Use GitHub repos **payout-targets-data** & **arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data** (hourly pulls)  
2. **Asset Discovery**  
   - Subdomains: Amass, Subfinder  
   - Endpoints & APIs: httpx, ffuf, Burp’s API Fuzzer  
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**  
   - Nuclei with low/medium templates (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, auth bypass)  
   - Custom scripts for JWT, OAuth, session logic  
4. **Pipeline Scheduling**  
   - Cron jobs: daily enumeration + scan → update inventory → alert on new assets  

***

## 5. Manual Testing Priorities  
- **Business Logic Flaws**: multi-step flows, payment manipulation, data tampering  
- **Auth/Authorization**: horizontal/vertical access control, JWT misuse  
- **Session Management**: token reuse, logout bypass  
- **API Chaining**: unauthorized API calls, rate limit bypass  
- **Proof-of-Concepts**: craft minimal reproducible steps for triage quality  

***

## 6. Program Discovery & Timing  
- **New & Expanded Scopes**: watch GitHub commits, Discord/Slack bug bounty channels  
- **Wildcard Domains**: prioritize `*.example.com` for broader coverage  
- **Reward Tiers**: target programs with defined low/medium payouts (e.g., ≥\$100)  
- **Fast Submission**: test and report immediately to avoid duplicates  

***

## 7. VDP Practice Track  
1. **Light Automation**  
   - Same toolchain but throttle scans to comply with policy  
2. **Deep Manual Exercises**  
   - Design multi-request workflows to uncover logic bypasses  
   - Focus on API rate limits, hidden endpoints, business rules  
3. **Program Choice**  
   - VDPs with explicit safe harbor, clear scope (e.g., government portals, open APIs)  

***

## 8. Continuous Improvement  
- **Community**: follow hunters on Twitter/Discord for early scope intel  
- **Skill Building**: alternate bounty weeks with VDP weeks to sharpen logic testing  
- **Metrics**: track time vs. findings ratio; refine automation wordlists and templates accordingly  

***

*Adhering to this roadmap ensures efficient automation of reconnaissance, strategic manual testing for impactful logic bugs, and an optimized focus on programs most likely to reward low- and medium-severity discoveries.*
