Nahamsec Methodology for Selecting and Approaching Bug Bounty Programs

# NahamSec’s Methodology for Selecting and Approaching Bug Bounty Programs

Drawing on his extensive HackerOne and pentesting experience, NahamSec advocates a structured, data-driven approach to program choice and sustained success.

## 1. Financial & Goal Planning  
- **Establish Your Bare Minimum**: Calculate monthly expenses (housing, utilities, food, “oh-shit” fund).  
- **Build a Runway**: Save 4–6 months of bare minimum to afford learning curves and dry spells.  
- **Set Quarterly Revenue Targets**: Divide annual income goals into manageable three-month milestones.

## 2. Program Selection Criteria  
- **High Average Payouts for Medium Bugs**: Target programs offering ≥\$500 for medium-severity issues to maximize ROI.  
- **Large Corporate Scopes with Micro-Apps**: Choose enterprises (e.g., finance, retail, streaming) whose ecosystems include multiple subdomains and auxiliary services (analytics, payments, ads).  
- **Active, Responsive Teams**: Favor programs with fast triage and clear communication to reduce time-to-payout.  
- **Emerging or Private Scopes**: Apply to newly launched or invite-only programs where competition is lower.

## 3. Reconnaissance & Automation  
- **Premade Data Feeds**: Use repositories like payout-targets-data and bounty-targets-data for up-to-date scope lists.  
- **Asset Discovery Pipeline**:  
  1. Subdomain enumeration (Amass, Subfinder)  
  2. Endpoint & API mapping (httpx, ffuf)  
  3. Automated scanning (Nuclei with medium-severity templates)  
- **Custom Scripting**: Automate repetitive validation of known payloads across endpoints based on insights from previous findings.

## 4. Deep Manual Testing  
- **Immerse in a Single Program**: Dedicate weeks to one target, exploring every workflow (registration, login, data submission, transactions).  
- **Business Logic Focus**: Chase patterns—if you find XSS in one feature, hunt similar inputs (comments, profiles, search).  
- **Proof-of-Concept Discipline**: Craft minimal, clear reproduction steps to impress triage teams and accelerate payouts.

## 5. Sustained Momentum  
- **Hacking Sprints**: Run 6–8-week intensive cycles aiming to meet quarterly goals or extend runway, then pivot to content or pentesting.  
- **Community Engagement**: Collaborate with peers (e.g., Zseano, Joel Margolis) for feedback, scope announcements, and moral support.  
- **Continuous Learning**: Treat “bugless” nights as lab time—experiment with new tools, methodologies, and recon approaches.

***

By combining **financial discipline**, **data-driven program selection**, **automated reconnaissance**, and **deep manual exploration** within focused hacking sprints, NahamSec consistently uncovers impactful vulnerabilities and sustains a high-earning bug bounty career.
