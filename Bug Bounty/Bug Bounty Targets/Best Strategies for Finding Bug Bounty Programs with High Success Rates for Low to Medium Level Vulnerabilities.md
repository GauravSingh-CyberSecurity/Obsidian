# Best Strategies for Finding Bug Bounty Programs with High Success Rates for Low to Medium Level Vulnerabilities

While there's **no guarantee of 100% success** in bug bounty hunting, certain strategies can significantly improve your chances of finding low to medium-level vulnerabilities that are more accessible to beginners and intermediate hunters.

## Understanding the Reality of Bug Bounty Competition

The bug bounty landscape has evolved dramatically. **Automation is now widely used, and most "low-hanging fruit" vulnerabilities get duplicated quickly if you're unlucky with timing**[1]. The industry has matured, meaning **less low-hanging fruit is available for the taking by common public automation**[2]. However, this doesn't mean opportunities don't exist—you just need to hunt smarter.

## Platform Selection Strategy

### Beginner-Friendly Platforms

**Intigriti** is consistently recommended for beginners because it offers **less competition than others**, has **a lot of local programs**, and **a great selection of targets**[3]. Unlike platforms like HackerOne where **you get negative karma if you report something that's not true**, Intigriti provides a more forgiving environment for learning[3].

**Bugcrowd** offers **curated targets and VDPs (Vulnerability Disclosure Programs)**[4], which are excellent for practice since **only 15% of hackers expect a bounty in return for submitting a vulnerability report via a VDP**[5].

### Less Competitive Options

Consider smaller or regional platforms like:
- **YesWeHack** for European companies[4]
- **BugBase** for Indian programs[6]
- **Bugv** which has **very basic programs for newcomers that aren't widely participated in**[7]

## Target Selection Criteria

### Wide Scope Programs

**Programs with wider scopes (at least a wildcard) get nearly 250% more findings than programs with limited scopes**[8]. Look for programs that include:
- **Wildcard domains** (*.example.com)
- **Large attack surfaces** like Amazon where **every new deployment, feature release, or UI design creates new opportunities**[9]
- **Extensive scope with accessible assets** (no subscription required)[10]

### Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs)

VDPs are **structured frameworks for hackers to document and submit security vulnerabilities** without monetary rewards but with **87% of organizations reporting at least one P1 vulnerability through their VDPs**[5]. These programs offer:
- **Lower competition** since there's no monetary incentive
- **Legal safe harbor** for ethical testing
- **Great practice opportunities** for building skills

## Strategic Vulnerability Targeting

### Focus on Business Logic and Manual Testing

Instead of relying on automated tools, focus on **manual testing for business logic flaws**[2]. Look for:
- **Business logic vulnerabilities** specific to the application
- **Authentication and authorization flaws**
- **Input validation issues** in custom functionalities
- **API endpoint vulnerabilities**

### Beginner-Friendly Bug Types

Target these **"low-hanging fruit" vulnerabilities** that beginners can realistically find[11]:
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** in less obvious locations
- **SQL Injection** in custom parameters
- **Access Control Issues**
- **Information Disclosure**

## Timing and Program Selection

### Target New Programs

**Monitor newly launched programs** using tools like the **payout-targets-data repository** which **provides continuously updated targets** and tracks **newly identified assets since the last update**[12]. New programs typically have:
- **Less competition**
- **More undiscovered vulnerabilities**
- **Eager companies** wanting to establish their security reputation

### Focus on Specific Industries

Choose programs in industries you understand or have experience with, such as:
- **E-commerce platforms** (familiar user flows)
- **Financial services** (common functionality patterns)
- **Educational platforms** (typically less hardened)

## Methodology for Success

### Consistency Over Intensity

**Bug bounty requires consistent effort for consistent results**[13]. **The more time you spend on the same target, the more security vulnerabilities you find**[13]. Plan **specific time slots each day or week** for hunting rather than sporadic intensive sessions.

### Program Research Approach

1. **Look for programs with broad scopes and clear rules**[11]
2. **Check for decent reward structures** even for low/medium severity issues
3. **Verify the program has fair bounty amounts**[10]
4. **Ensure accessible assets** without requiring subscriptions

### Avoid Common Mistakes

- **Don't rely entirely on automation**—it leads to duplicates[2]
- **Don't jump between programs quickly**—stick with one for weeks[13]
- **Don't delay submissions**—report bugs immediately to avoid duplicates[13]
- **Don't overlook business impact**—focus on what actually affects the company[2]

## Building Your Success Rate

### Community Engagement

**Join bug bounty communities** on platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Reddit to:
- **Learn about new programs** before they become competitive
- **Share knowledge** and learn from experienced hunters
- **Get insights** on which programs are paying fairly

### Skill Development Focus

Instead of chasing every vulnerability type, **develop expertise in specific areas** where you can compete effectively:
- **API security** for those with development background
- **Mobile applications** if you have mobile dev experience  
- **Business logic** for those who understand user workflows

The key to success in bug bounty hunting isn't finding a magical program with guaranteed vulnerabilities—it's about **strategic program selection, consistent effort, manual testing skills, and understanding that success comes from patience and persistence** rather than automation and luck.
