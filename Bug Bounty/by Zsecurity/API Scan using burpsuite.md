i used this(https://converter.swagger.io/) to convert an openapi definition that is (https://jalchar-api.bnhs.org/openapi.json) this was in version 3.1.0 and i converted it to 3.0.0 using the converter because burpsuite dont allow the 3.1.0 version

than i saved it in the file ![[Jalchar_api.json]]   
(home/ BNHS vapt/Jalchar_api 1.json)

in new api scan i upload this file and then start the scan.
