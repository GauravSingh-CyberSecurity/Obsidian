Great question, Gaurav! Here's a list of 10 P3 and 10 P4 vulnerabilities that are realistically high-success and often awarded on platforms like Bugcrowd, HackerOne, and Intigriti, provided you explain and demonstrate impact clearly.

✅ Top 10 P3 Vulnerabilities That Are Frequently Awarded 💸

#	Vulnerability	Why It’s P3

1️⃣	Reflected XSS (with PoC)	User input reflected in page → can lead to phishing, session hijack
2️⃣	Stored XSS (low-impact area)	Comment section, profile, etc.
3️⃣	IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)	Access another user’s data (like invoice, files)
4️⃣	CORS Misconfiguration (with sensitive data exposed)	Wildcard origins or missing credential validation
5️⃣	Session Fixation	Reuse of session IDs via login links
6️⃣	Sensitive Info in JavaScript files	API keys, credentials, tokens exposed
7️⃣	Misconfigured S3 buckets or open storage	Accessible private files
8️⃣	Exposed admin or debug endpoints	E.g., /debug, /admin, /console
9️⃣	Weak password reset logic	Predictable token, missing rate limit
🔟	OAuth Misconfigurations	Bypass login, redirect flaws, open redirects with redirect_uri


> 💡 Impact must be clearly demonstrated with real data access or session manipulation.

✅ Top 10 P4 Vulnerabilities That Are Often Awarded 🪙

#	Vulnerability	Why It’s P4

1️⃣	Missing Security Headers	No Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.
2️⃣	Open Redirects	Can redirect users to phishing domains
3️⃣	Autocomplete Enabled on Password Fields	Insecure UX flaw
4️⃣	Insecure Cookie Flags	Missing HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite
5️⃣	Clickjacking	No X-Frame-Options allows clickjacking attack
6️⃣	Information Disclosure (Emails, usernames)	Seen in response or error
7️⃣	Verbose Error Messages / Stack Trace	Tech info leakage
8️⃣	Exposed Internal IPs	Found in headers, comments, responses
9️⃣	Unvalidated Redirects in OAuth Flows	Redirect URI can be attacker-controlled
🔟	Rate-Limit Missing (Low-Risk Endpoint)	No limit on login attempts, but no bypass shown


> 🔍 Even these P4s are accepted if well-documented and reported professionally.

Here's a ==summary of bug bounty recommendations or top advice from the following well-known hunters:== Nahamaec, Santiago Lopez, Zseano, Jhaddix, and Stök — based on interviews, blogs, talks, and courses:


---

🔹 1. NahamSec (Ben Sadeghipour)

Focus Areas: Reconnaissance, automation, subdomain enumeration

Key Tools: Amass, Subfinder, Nuclei, httpx

Top Recommendations:

Automate your recon as much as possible.

Build your own recon pipeline — don’t just rely on others’ tools.

Watch for asset inventory expansion (new subdomains, staging, mobile endpoints).

Collaborate and share notes with the community.

Focus on high impact bugs over quantity (e.g., IDORs, account takeovers).

Join bug bounty programs early (before public release).




---

🔹 2. Santiago Lopez (@try_to_hack)

Focus Areas: Broken access control, business logic

Key Tools: Burp Suite, manual testing

Top Recommendations:

Start learning by doing CTFs and OWASP Juice Shop.

Focus on one category at a time (e.g., IDOR, SSRF, etc.).

Learn how apps work — understand authentication flows and how data is processed.

Be consistent; success comes with daily practice.

Learn how to write detailed, professional reports (it builds trust with triagers).

Be persistent. He hunted 5 months before his first valid report.




---

🔹 3. Zseano

Focus Areas: XSS, authentication flaws, bug bounty mindset

Top Recommendations:

Master the basics: understand how each OWASP Top 10 vuln works.

Focus on low-hanging fruits others skip: dev/test environments, older endpoints.

Hunt on targets you're passionate about (it keeps you engaged).

Use mind maps and hunting methodologies to track your flow.

Run Burp Suite plugins like Param Miner and Turbo Intruder to find edge cases.

Build your own bug bounty notes/wiki.

Learn from every duplicate and invalid — don't ignore them.




---

🔹 4. Jhaddix (Jason Haddix)

Focus Areas: Reconnaissance, app structure mapping, vulnerability chaining

Key Tools: recon-ng, GitHub dorking, JS recon, hak5, JSParser, OneForAll

Top Recommendations:

Recon is king — 80% of good bugs come from good recon.

Understand how JavaScript links to hidden API endpoints or secrets.

Use Content Discovery via wordlists and automation (ffuf, dirsearch).

Monitor GitHub leaks and other open-source platforms.

Use asset correlation — find mobile APIs, internal subdomains, forgotten systems.

Learn how to chain vulnerabilities: e.g., SSRF → credential leakage → RCE.




---

🔹 5. Stök

Focus Areas: Community building, mindset, API security

Top Recommendations:

Don't chase only CVEs — chase understanding.

Focus on API hacking; this is the future of bug bounties.

Be visible and active in the community: networking = learning.

"Bug bounty is not a sprint; it’s a marathon" — be consistent.

Build your personal brand (blogs, YouTube, X).

Stay updated with modern web architectures (GraphQL, JWT, OAuth).
